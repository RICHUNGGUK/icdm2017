All instances of the framework inherit machine-checked proofs of the metatheory such as compositionality and bisimulation congruence. We present a generic analysis tool for psi-calculus instances, enabling symbolic execution and (bi) simulation checking for both unicast and broadcast communication. The tool also provides a library for implementing new psi-calculus instances. We provide examples from traditional communication protocols and wireless sensor networks. We also describe the theoretical foundations of the tool, including an improved symbolic operational semantics, with additional support for scoped broadcast communication.", "paper_title": "The Psi-Calculi Workbench: A Generic Tool for Applied Process Calculi", "paper_id": "WOS:000349302200009"}
