Design/methodology/approach - Electrical prospecting is an important method of geophysical exploration and the electrical prospecting instruments are required to detect very weak electrical signals against strong interferences. Recently, pseudo-random correlation coding has been widely applied in telecommunications and measurement and test systems to improve the signal noise ratio with great success, but has not been used in electric prospecting. This paper theoretically investigated the application model of pseudo-random correlation techniques in electrical prospecting. Findings - The model of pseudo-random correlation techniques in electrical prospecting, including its principle, detailed protocol and parameter selection, is established. Practical implications - With the continuing improvement in the capacity of electrical prospecting transmitters, the pseudo-random correlation method will be widely used in electrical prospecting. Originality/value - The pseudo-random correlation techniques is originally investigated for its application in electrical prospecting. This paper is aimed at researchers and engineers in geophysical exploration.", "paper_title": "Application model of pseudo-random correlation method in electrical prospecting", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700032"}
