It is the first step toward developing a comprehensive virtual human model for studying Chinese medicine. Students can learn and practice acupuncture in the proposed 3-D interactive virtual environment that supports a force feedback linterface for needle insertion. Thus, students not only \"see\" but also \"touch\" the virtual patient. With high performance computers, highly informative and flexible visualization of acupuncture points of various related meridian and collateral can be highlighted to guide the students during training. A computer-based expert system using our newly. proposed intelligent fuzzy petri net is designed and implemented to train the students to treat different diseases using acupuncture. Such an intelligent virtual reality system can provide an interesting and effective learning environment for Chinese acupuncture.", "paper_title": "Intelligent inferencing and haptic simulation for Chinese acupuncture learning and training", "paper_id": "WOS:000235550600007"}
