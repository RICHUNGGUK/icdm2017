These models must be persisted in a way that allows their manipulation by client applications without fully loading them. In this paper, we propose Morsa, a model repository that provides scalable manipulation of large models through load on demand and incremental store; model persistence is supported by a NoSQL database. We discuss some load on demand and incremental store algorithms as well as a database design. A prototype that integrates transparently with EMF is presented, and its evaluation demonstrates that it is capable of fully managing large models with a limited amount of memory. Moreover, a set of benchmarks has been executed, exhibiting better performance than the EMF XMI file-based persistence and the most widely used model repository, CDO.", "paper_title": "A repository for scalable model management", "paper_id": "WOS:000349026100014"}
