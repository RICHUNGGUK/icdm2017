We demonstrate that Random Forest regression-voting can be used to generate high quality response images quickly. Rather than using a generative or a discriminative model to evaluate each pixel, a regressor is used to cast votes for the optimal position of each point. We show that this leads to fast and accurate shape model matching when applied in the Constrained Local Model framework. We evaluate the technique in detail, and compare it with a range of commonly used alternatives across application areas: the annotation of the joints of the hands in radiographs and the detection of feature points in facial images. We show that our approach outperforms alternative techniques, achieving what we believe to be the most accurate results yet published for hand joint annotation and state-of-the-art performance for facial feature point detection.", "paper_title": "Robust and Accurate Shape Model Matching Using Random Forest Regression-Voting", "paper_id": "WOS:000359216600010"}
