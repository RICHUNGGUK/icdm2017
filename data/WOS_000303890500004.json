WMSNs are gaining more popularity day by day as they are envisioned to support a large number of both non-real time and real-time multimedia applications. However, satisfying the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements of multimedia transmission in a resource-constrained sensor network environment places new challenges to routing. As an outcome, optimal energy and application-specific QoS aware routing for WMSNs has gained considerable research attention recently. In this paper, current state-of-the-art in energy-efficient routing techniques for WMSNs is surveyed together with the highlights of the performance issues of each strategy. We outline the design challenges of routing protocols for WMSNs followed by the limitations of current techniques designed for non-multimedia data transmission. Further, a classification of recent routing protocols for WMSNs and a discussion of possible future research trends are presented.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Energy-Efficient Routing Techniques with QoS Assurances for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303890500004"}
