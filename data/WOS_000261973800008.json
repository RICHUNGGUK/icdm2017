Introducing these features is another way to make material usage more efficient by lowering or avoiding stress con centrations and making the structure even stronger. In this brief note, a new crossing sensitivity filter is proposed for structural topology optimization with chamfering and rounding. This method also ensures the final optimal solution without checkerboard patterns or mesh-dependency. It can also partially prevent one-node hinges. Numerical examples that include both design of stiffest/strongest structures and synthesis of compliant mechanisms are provided.", "paper_title": "A crossing sensitivity filter for structural topology optimization with chamfering, rounding, and checkerboard-free patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000261973800008"}
