We introduce interactive images in the context of man-made environments wherein objects are simple and regular, share various non-local relations (e. g., coplanarity, parallelism, etc.), and are often repeated. Our interactive framework creates partial scene reconstructions based on cuboid-proxies with minimal user interaction. It subsequently allows a range of intuitive image edits mimicking real-world behavior, which are otherwise difficult to achieve. Effectively, the user simply provides high-level semantic hints, while our system ensures plausible operations by conforming to the extracted non-local relations. We demonstrate our system on a range of real-world images and validate the plausibility of the results using a user study.", "paper_title": "Interactive Images: Cuboid Proxies for Smart Image Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308250300075"}
