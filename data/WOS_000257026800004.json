Mapping of characteristic substructures is used to determine atom match rates in active molecules. Comparison of match rates of bonded atoms defines a hierarchical molecular fragmentation scheme. Active compounds are encoded as fragmentation pathways isolated from core trees. These paths are amenable to biological sequence alignment methods in combination with substructure-based scoring functions. From multiple core path alignments, consensus fragment sequences are derived that represent compound activity classes. Consensus fragment sequences weighted by increasing structural specificity can also be used to map molecules and search databases for active compounds.", "paper_title": "Core trees and consensus fragment sequences for molecular representation and similarity analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000257026800004"}
