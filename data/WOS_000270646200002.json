A variety of data driven modelling approaches have been applied but their performance has produced mixed results. In this study we apply both parametric (neural networks with active neurons) and nonparametric (analog complexing) self-organising modelling methods for the daily prediction of the exchange rate market. We also propose a combined approach where the parametric and nonparametric self-organising methods are combined sequentially, exploiting the advantages of the individual methods with the aim of improving their performance. The combined method is found to produce promising results and to outperform the individual methods when tested with two exchange rates: the American Dollar and the Deutche Mark against the British Pound.
