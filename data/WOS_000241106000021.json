The Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is employed for fuzzy modeling of uncertain nonlinear system. Based on the fuzzy model, the internal model principle (IMP) is adopted to design the robust fuzzy tracking controller. Then the robust fuzzy observer is designed independently. Sufficient conditions are derived for stabilization of the robust fuzzy tracking controller and the robust fuzzy observer in the sense of Lyapunov asymptotic stability. The main contribution of this paper is the development of the robust fuzzy tracking control based on the internal model principle of uncertain nonlinear systems. A simulation example is given to illustrate the design procedures and asymptotic tracking performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust fuzzy tracking control of nonlinear systems with uncertainty via T-S fuzzy model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000021"}
