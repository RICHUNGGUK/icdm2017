We call the kind of SVMs where C is determined automatically from the application of a GA a \"Genetic SVM\" or GSVM. In order to test the performance of our GSVM, we solved a representative set of problems by applying one-versus-one majority voting and one-versus-all winner-takes-all strategies. In all of these the algorithm displayed very good performance. The relevance of the problem, the algorithm, the experiments and the results obtained are discussed.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary training of SVM for multiple category classification problems with self-adaptive parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100037"}
