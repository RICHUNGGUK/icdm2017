In this paper, we present a novel 3D face recognition system which performs quality assessment on input images prior to recognition. More specifically, a reject option is provided to allow the system operator to eliminate the incoming images of poor quality, e.g. failure acquisition of 3D image, exaggerated facial expressions, etc.. Furthermore, an automated approach for preprocessing is presented to reduce the number of failure cases in that stage. The experimental results show that the 3D face recognition performance is significantly improved by taking the quality of 3D facial images into account. The proposed system achieves the verification rate of 97.09% at the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.1% on the FRGC v2.0 data set.", "paper_title": "A novel framework for automatic 3D face recognition using quality assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000331084000018"}
