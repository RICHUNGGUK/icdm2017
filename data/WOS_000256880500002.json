There is a consensus that DWS-based applications, such as pervasive computing, sensor networks, wireless information networks, and speech and data communication networks, will form the backbone of the next technological revolution. Simultaneously, with great economic, industrial, consumer, and scientific potential, DWSs pose numerous technical challenges. Among them, two are widely considered as crucial: autonomous localized operation and minimization of energy consumption. We address the fundamental problem of how to maximize the lifetime of the network using only local information, while preserving network connectivity. We start by introducing the care-free sleep (CS) Theorem that provides provably optimal conditions for a node to go into sleep mode while ensuring that global connectivity is not affected. The CS theorem is the basis for an efficient localized algorithm that decides which nodes will go to into sleep mode and for how long. We have also developed mechanisms for collecting neighborhood information and for the coordination of distributed energy minimization protocols. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using a comprehensive study of the performance of the algorithm over a wide range of network parameters. Another important highlight is the first mathematical and Monte Carlo analysis that establishes the importance of considering nodes within a small number of hops in order to preserve energy.", "paper_title": "Techniques for maintaining connectivity in wireless ad-hoc networks under energy constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000256880500002"}
