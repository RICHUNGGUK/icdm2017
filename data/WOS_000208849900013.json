We also review some properties of Sylvester Hadamard matrices, their Smith Normal Forms, and pivot patterns of Hadamard matrices when Gaussian Elimination with complete pivoting is applied on them. The pivot values which appear reconfirm the above non-embedding results.", "paper_title": "Some remarks on Hadamard matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000208849900013"}
