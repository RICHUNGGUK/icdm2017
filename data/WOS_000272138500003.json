As independent variables, or compound descriptors, the Abraham descriptors often employed in linear free energy relationships were used. Much better results were obtained from the nonlinear ANN model than from multiple linear regression. The average absolute error, average relative error and root mean square error in the calculation of log (BMF) by the ANN model were 0.055, 0.051 and 0.097 for the training set and 0.11, 0.086 and 0.175 for the internal validation set, respectively. The degree of importance of each descriptor was evaluated by carrying out a sensitivity analysis approach for the nonlinear model. The results obtained reveal that the order of importance is the pollutant volume, the pollutant dipolarity/polarizability and the pollutant excess molar refraction. In order to examine the credibility of the obtained ANN model the leave-many-out cross-validation test was applied which gave Q2= 0.827 and SPRESS = 0.15. Also the Y-scrambling procedure was applied to the ANN model in order to examine the effect of chance correlations. The results obtained reveal that it is possible to predict the BMFs of organochlorine pollutants using a nonlinear ANN model with Abraham descriptors as inputs.", "paper_title": "Prediction of biomagnification factors for some organochlorine compounds using linear free energy relationship parameters and artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272138500003"}
