The selected ligands were docked into the binding site of the 3D model of DP- IV using the GOLD software, and the possible interaction models between DP-IV and the inhibitors were obtained. Based on the binding conformations of these fluoropyrrolidine amides and their alignment inside the binding pocket of DP- IV, predictive 3D-QSAR models were established by CoMFA and CoMSIA analyses, which had conventional r(2) and cross-validated coefficient values (r(cv)(2)) up to 0.982 and 0.555 for CoMFA and 0.953 and 0.613 for CoMSIA, respectively. The predictive ability of these models was validated by six compounds that were in the testing set. Structure-based investigations and the final 3D-QSAR results provide the guide for designing new potent inhibitors.", "paper_title": "3D-QSAR studies on fluoropyrrolidine amides as dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors by CoMFA and CoMSIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000248302100006"}
