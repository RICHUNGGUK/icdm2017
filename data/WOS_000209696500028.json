Assuming the channels, for both the desired and the interfering signals, to experience Rayleigh fading, first, exact and upper-bound expressions for the end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) are derived. Then, the moment generating function of the upper-bound end-to-end SINR is obtained. According to the latter, the error and outage probabilities are assessed in closed form. Further, simple and general asymptotic expressions for the error and outage probabilities, which explicitly show the coding and the diversity gains, are derived and discussed. Finally, the analysis is validated by comparing the corresponding numerical results with Monte Carlo simulations, sustained by insightful discussions.", "paper_title": "Performance of Non-Symmetric Relaying Networks in the Presence of Interferers with Unequal Powers", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696500028"}
