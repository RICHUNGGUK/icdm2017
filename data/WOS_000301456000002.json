[M. Balcerzak, K. Dems, A. Komisarski, Statistical convergence and ideal convergence for sequences of functions, J. Math. Anal. Appl. 328 (2007) 715-729]. In this paper, we use the notion of lambda-statistical convergence in order to generalize these concepts. We establish some inclusion relations between them. We apply our new notion of lambda-equi-statistical convergence to prove a Korovkin type approximation theorem and we show that our theorem is a non-trivial extension of some well-known Korovkin type approximation theorems. Finally, we prove a Voronovskaja type approximation theorem via the concept of.-equi-statistical convergence. Some interesting examples are also displayed here in support of our definitions and results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
