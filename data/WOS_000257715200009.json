The need for overcoming the bottleneck provoked by the manual construction of ontologies has generated several studies and research on obtaining semi-automatic methods to build ontologies. Most techniques for learning domain ontologies from free text have important limitations. Thus, they can extract concepts so that only taxonomies are generally produced although there are other types of semantic relations relevant in knowledge modelling. This paper presents a language-independent approach for extracting knowledge from medical natural language documents. The knowledge is represented by means of ontologies that can have multiple semantic relationships among concepts.", "paper_title": "A knowledge acquisition methodology to ontology construction for information retrieval from medical documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000257715200009"}
