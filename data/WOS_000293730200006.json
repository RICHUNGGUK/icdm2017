The generalized Brieman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (BFOS) algorithm is adopted for optimizing rate-distortion performance for bandwidth allocation. Given a distribution of clients, the algorithm is able to find the convex hull in the rate-distortion plane with low computational complexity. It can be further simplified by the assumption that the video sequences exhibit convex rate-distortion performance. The algorithm needs no feedback from clients. It is therefore well-suited for CDN-based media-streaming applications with high client variations.", "paper_title": "Archived Video Delivery Based on Fast Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293730200006"}
