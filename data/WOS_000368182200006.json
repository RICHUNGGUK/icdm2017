In this article, we discuss a new approach for measuring social capital which builds upon cooperative game theory. The new approach not only turns out to be a natural tool for modeling social capital, but also captures various aspects of this phenomenon that are not captured by other approaches.", "paper_title": "A New Approach to Measure Social Capital using Game-Theoretic Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000368182200006"}
