In this paper we prove a similar statement when nonnegative integers p (k) are given for 3a parts per thousand currency signka parts per thousand currency signr, except for k=5 and k=7 (but including p (6)). We prove that there are infinitely many values p (5),p (7) such that there exists a simple convex polyhedron having precisely p (k) faces of size k for every ka parts per thousand yen3. We derive an extension to arbitrary closed surfaces, yielding maps of arbitrarily high face-width. Our proof suggests a general method for obtaining results of this kind.", "paper_title": "An Eberhard-Like Theorem for Pentagons and Heptagons", "paper_id": "WOS:000282700100015"}
