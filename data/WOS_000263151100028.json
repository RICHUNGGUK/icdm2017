The result is of interest from a practical as well as a theoretical viewpoint. The new method is surprisingly simple and is more efficient than the standard method of simulation by inversion of the cumulative distribution function. The method is also generalized to simulate the two-sided power distribution.", "paper_title": "A new method to simulate the triangular distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000263151100028"}
