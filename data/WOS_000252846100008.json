This paper explores KM research in influential journals for the period 2000-2004. A total of 160 KM articles in ten top-tier information systems and management journals are analyzed. Articles that may serve as useful exemplars of KM research from positivist, interpretivist, and critical pluralist paradigms are selected. We find that KM research in information systems journals differs from that in management journals, but neither makes a balanced use of positivist and non-positivist research approaches.
