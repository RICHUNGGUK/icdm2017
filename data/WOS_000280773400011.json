We give some new characterizations of balanced words connected to the Kawasaki-Ising model and to the notion of derivative of a word. Moreover we consider two different generalizations of the notion of balance, and we find some relations between them. Some of our results can be generalized to non periodic infinite words as well.", "paper_title": "BALANCE PROPERTIES AND DISTRIBUTION OF SQUARES IN CIRCULAR WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280773400011"}
