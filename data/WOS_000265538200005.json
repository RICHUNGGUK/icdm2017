We propose and develop an interactive force-sensation-based navigation system for waiters based on a force perception technology that we have proposed. The navigation system consists of our new hand-held haptic interface and a camera-based position and posture identification system. Since the proposed compact haptic interface does not require external grounding, it can be used outside the laboratory and does not interrupt human activity. We verify the feasibility of the system in trials where we collected the responses of system users.", "paper_title": "Location-free haptic interaction for large-area social applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000265538200005"}
