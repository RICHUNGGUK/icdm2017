As we have developed a basic concurrent language with interferencial coefficients, I pi-calculus, to describe aberrance in biological models, a typing system for I pi-calculus is proposed for achieving secrecy of signals in signal transduction. We show that this typing system guarantees that, if signal transduction typechecks, then it does not leak aberrance of signals.", "paper_title": "Secrecy of signals by typing in signal transduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100047"}
