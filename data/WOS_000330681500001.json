However, the unique spectral properties of an SMT signal could be degraded by a non-linear element (e.g. a Power Amplifier (PA)) in the transmitter. Deliberate baseband clipping can be applied to the transmitted signal, reducing the notable high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). The objective of this paper is to give a brief introduction to the SMT scheme, with a special emphasis on deliberate clipping effects and their compensation. The paper introduces two receiver-oriented iterative methods aiming at the restoration of the baseband Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of a non-clipped signal. The methods are evaluated and compared based on numerical simulations. The paper concludes with the selection of a possible candidate for use in systems applying deliberately clipped SMT signals.", "paper_title": "Iterative signal reconstruction of deliberately clipped SMT signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500001"}
