The sharp-interface approach consists of several components: a discontinuous Galerkin solver for compressible fluid flow, a level-set tracking algorithm to follow the movement of the interface and a coupling of both by a ghost-fluid approach with use of a local Riemann solver at the interface. There are several novel techniques used: the discontinuous Galerkin scheme allows locally a subcell resolution to enhance the interface resolution and an interior finite volume Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) approximation at the interface. The level-set equation is solved by the same discontinuous Galerkin scheme. To obtain a very good approximation of the interface curvature, the accuracy of the level-set field is improved and smoothed by an additional PNPM-reconstruction. The capabilities of the method for the simulation of compressible two-phase flow are demonstrated for a droplet at equilibrium, an oscillating ellipsoidal droplet, and a shock-droplet interaction problem at Mach 3.
