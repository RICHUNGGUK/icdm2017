The scheme is based on the quartic three-directional Box-spline scheme, and is guaranteed to generate C limit functions whenever the valency n of the extraordinary vertex is in the range 4 <= n <= 20. The new scheme differs from the commonly used subdivision schemes by the fact that it applies special subdivision rules near edges of the original triangulation, which emanate from the extraordinary vertex, and not only in the vicinity of the extraordinary vertex.
