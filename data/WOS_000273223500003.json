We present a time-space trade-off that leads to algorithms improving the previously known complexities for both problems. In particular, we significantly improve the space bounds, which in practical applications are likely to be a bottleneck.", "paper_title": "Improved Approximate String Matching and Regular Expression Matching on Ziv-Lempel Compressed Texts", "paper_id": "WOS:000273223500003"}
