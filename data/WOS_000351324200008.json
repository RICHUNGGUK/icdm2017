However, guaranteeing delivery with geographic routing in arbitrary dimensional WSN is still a challenge due to the complexity of available solutions. In this work we propose an approach that assigns virtual coordinates to the sensors based on recursive partitioning of the network. We then give a routing protocol that works on this space of virtual coordinates and that guarantees delivery in both two dimensional and three dimensional WSN. We prove by simulation that, as compared to the shortest path, the path length obtained by the routing protocol is only slightly larger and, with an appropriate configuration of the partitioning, smaller than other comparable routing approaches.
