Design/methodology/approach - This is a discussion paper exploring the key issues surrounding generalized measures. Findings - The concrete contents of the study include generalized measure views, dimension theory, concepts, logic, theories, Einstein's relativity, quality-quantity-degree, methodology of physics, theorems in pansystems mathematics and physics explained within the framework of pan-scale transformations. Originality/value - Provides an overview of generalized scales based on pansystems-relative quantification.", "paper_title": "A pansystems approach to measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000242322300023"}
