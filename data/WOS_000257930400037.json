Furthermore, they use all the image pixels, although actually not all of the pixels are effective in illumination estimation. Consequently, how to select a proper color constancy algorithm from existing algorithms and how to select effective(or useful) pixels from an image are two most important problems for natural images color constancy. In this paper, a novel Color Constancy method using Effective Regions (CCER) is proposed, which consists of the proper algorithm selection and effective regions selection. For a given image, the most proper algorithm is selected according to its Weilbull distribution while its effective regions are chosen based on image similarity. The experiments show promising results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Color constancy based on effective regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000257930400037"}
