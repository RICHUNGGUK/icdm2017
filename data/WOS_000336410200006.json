It is a common and serious side effect of insulin therapy in patients with diabetes. In this paper, we propose a system model to measure physiological parameters continuously to provide hypoglycaemia detection for Type 1 diabetes mellitus (TIDM) patients. The resulting model is a fuzzy inference system (FIS). The heart rate (HR), corrected QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal (QT,), change of HR, and change of QT, are used as the input of the FIS to detect the hypoglycaemic episodes. An intelligent optimiser is designed to optimise the FIS parameters that govern the membership functions and the fuzzy rules. The intelligent optimiser has an implementation framework that incorporates two wavelet mutated differential evolution optimisers to enhance the training performance. A multi-objective optimisation approach is used to perform the training of the FIS in order to meet the medical standards on sensitivity and specificity. Experiments with real data of 16 children (569 data points) with TIDM are studied in this paper. The data are randomly separated into a training set with 5 patients (199 data points), a validation set with 5 patients (177 data points) and a testing set with 5 patients (193 data points). Experiment results show that the proposed FIS tuned by the proposed intelligent optimiser can offer good performance of classification.
