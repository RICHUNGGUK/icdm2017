This paper shows three results of such a type that are stronger in some sense than other ones because (a) they deal with models of quantum finite automata with very little quantumness (so-called semi-quantum one-and two-way finite automata); (b) differences, even comparing with probabilistic classical automata, are bigger than expected; (c) a trade-off between the number of classical and quantum basis states needed is demonstrated in one case and (d) languages (or the promise problem) used to show main results are very simple and often explored ones in automata theory or in communication complexity, with seemingly little structure that could be utilized.", "paper_title": "ON THE STATE COMPLEXITY OF SEMI-QUANTUM FINITE AUTOMATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000339168300003"}
