This facilitates application of predefined fiber mats and reduces the risk of failure such as delamination and matrix cracking problems. The method concerns simultaneous determination of the optimum thickness and fiber orientation throughout a laminated structure with fixed outer geometry. The laminate thickness may vary as an integer number of plies, and possible fiber orientations are limited to a finite set. The conceptual combinatorial problem is relaxed to a continuous problem and solved on basis of interpolation schemes with penalization through the so-called Discrete Material Optimization method, explicitly including manufacturing constraints as a large number of sparse linear constraints. The methodology is demonstrated on several numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Topology and thickness optimization of laminated composites including manufacturing constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000322342300002"}
