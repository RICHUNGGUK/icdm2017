We assume that a decentralized dynamic output feedback has been designed for an interconnected continuous-time LTI system so that the closed-loop system is stable and a desired H-infinity disturbance attenuation level is achieved, and that the subsystem measurement outputs are quantized before they are passed to the local controllers. We propose a local-output-dependent strategy for updating the parameters of the quantizers, so that the overall closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and achieves the same H-infinity disturbance attenuation level. Both the pre-designed controllers and the parameters of the quantizers are constructed in a decentralized manner, depending on local measurement outputs.", "paper_title": "DECENTRALIZED DESIGN OF INTERCONNECTED H-infinity , FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH QUANTIZED SIGNALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321804300006"}
