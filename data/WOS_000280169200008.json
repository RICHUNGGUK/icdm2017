This creates significant problems to Internet Service Providers (ISPs), not only because of the added complexity in traffic engineering, but the increase of traffic, in particular on the cross-ISP links, implies congestion and a higher operating cost. In this paper, we consider an ISP-friendly file distribution protocol which uses the \"exploiting-the-locality principle\" (ELP) to reduce the cross-ISP traffic. To show its benefit, we derive an upper and lower bound of cross-ISP traffic for the protocols which rely on ELP and show that the cross-ISP traffic can be reduced significantly when the number of peers within an ISP increases. To carry out realistic study, we design and implement our ISP-friendly protocol (which is compatible with the current BitTorrent protocol) and carry out large scale experiments on PlanetLab to measure the reduction of the cross ISP-traffic and the file downloading time. More important, we also show how the proposed ISP-friendly protocol can handle the \"black-hole\" security attack. This paper sheds light on the merits and design direction of ISP-friendly content distribution protocols.", "paper_title": "An ISP-Friendly File Distribution Protocol: Analysis, Design, and Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000280169200008"}
