These schemes select only the best relay from multiple relaying candidates to cooperate with a communication link. In the present paper, we reviewed recently proposed cooperative communication protocols that integrate with relay selection mechanisms. The key design issues for relay selection mechanisms, for example, relaying candidate selection, optimal relay assignment, and cooperative transmission, were identified. We further discussed the challenges of optimal relay assignment in multi-hop wireless sensor networks and presented the potential applications of cooperative communications with a relay selection in such networks. Future research directions were outlined, for example, the issues of service differentiation and system fairness in cooperative communication systems and the joint use of game theory and adaptive learning techniques in relaying candidate selection and optimal-relay assignment mechanisms for efficient allocation of network resources.
