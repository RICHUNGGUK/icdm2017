It is known that each proper suffix of the infinite Fibonacci word is an r-Fibonacci word pattern, r is an element of {0, 1}. In this paper, we consider the suffixes of the two two-way infinite extensions G and G' of the infinite Fibonacci word. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for suffixes of G and G' to be r-Fibonacci word patterns. This gives us all the mechanical words with slope alpha = root 5-1/2 which are r-Fibonacci word patterns. All possible r-seed words of each of them are determined. Finally, images of suffixes of G and G' under the action of certain Sturmian morphisms are computed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
