However, a number of applications can be stated in terms of the watermark detection problem (also named zero-bit watermarking), and this situation has been seldom addressed in the literature for quantization-based techniques. In this context, we carry out a complete performance analysis of dithered uniform quantizer-based QIM with DC under additive white Gaussian noise. Using large deviation theory, performance is evaluated according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the total probability of detection error. Under the white Gaussian host signal assumption, scalar DC-QIM is compared with other existing watermarking methods, including quantized projection (QP), spread spectrum (SS) and improved SS (ISS, for which zero-bit watermarking performances with correlation detector are also proposed). Among the compared methods, it is shown that dithered scalar DC-QIM is the more relevant choice to address zero-bit watermarking, due to its host independent performance. A short comparison is also provided with respect to the corresponding transmission problem, thus evaluating the loss in performance due to the detection. We conclude in measuring the performance gain that could be provided by the use of more sophisticated lattice quantizers; than the cubic structure.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of scalar DC-QIM for zero-bit watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000246740700015"}
