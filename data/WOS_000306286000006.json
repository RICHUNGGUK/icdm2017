Due to the growing com-plexity of such systems, there is a need to design them in a way which enables adaptation to changes in the execution environment. This paper presents the Adaptive ESB framework for adaptive execution of services with the use of statistical models representing knowledge about service execution. Statisti- cal models are exploited in many different areas, but applying them to SOA applications requires specific methods for their identification, updating and processing. A statistical model of service execution represents knowledge of how a complex system behaves as a high-level abstraction of a system related to the problem space.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Enterprise Service Bus", "paper_id": "WOS:000306286000006"}
