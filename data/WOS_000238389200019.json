The signal of surface electromyographic signal (sEMG) can reflect the changes of muscular fatigue at certain extent. In many years, the application of signal of sEMG on evaluation muscular fatigue mainly focus on two aspects of time and frequency respectively. The new method Hilbert-Huang Transform(HHT) has the powerful ability of analyzing nonlinear and non-stationary data in both time and frequency aspect together. The method has self-adaptive basis and is better for feature extraction as we can obtain the local and instantaneous frequency of the signals. In this paper, we chose an experiment of the static biceps data of twelve adult subjects under the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of 80%. The experimental results proved that this method as a new thinking has an obvious potential for the biomedical signal analysis.", "paper_title": "The study on the sEMG signal characteristics of muscular fatigue based on the Hilbert-Huang Transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200019"}
