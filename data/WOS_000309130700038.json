Our ASIC is based on the serializer architecture which maintains the constant output data rate for various resolutions of incoming video signals from VGA to UXGA. With this, a wide-band phase-locked-loop in a serializer and a continuous-rate clock-and-data-recovery circuit in a de-serializer are not necessary. The serializer ASIC contains clock-and-data-recovery circuits, de-multiplexers, a digital processing block, a phase-locked-loop, multiplexers. A VCSEL driver circuit is also integrated so that it can be used for long-haul transmission with multimode fiber. The ASIC produces 5.28-Gb/s serialized driving currents for VCSEL from parallel input signals. It occupies 3.45 mm(2) and consumes 151.7 mW.", "paper_title": "A 5.28-Gb/s serializer ASIC for uncompressed long-haul multimedia interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700038"}
