This paper presents a Meta-Scheduler for grid computing that does not need any given information about tasks length or tasks arrival time unlike traditional dynamic heuristics. Our Meta-Scheduler is of multi-criteria type, because it solves two conflicting objectives: minimize the makespan of a set of tasks and distribute these tasks in a balanced way among the resources of the Grid. Experimental results using fuzzy scheduler show that, through our proposal, we achieve these two objectives and improve dynamic heuristics presented in prior literature.", "paper_title": "A MULTI-CRITERIA META-FUZZY-SCHEDULER FOR INDEPENDENT TASKS IN GRID COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000301029300010"}
