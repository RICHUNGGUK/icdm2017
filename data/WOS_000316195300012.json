However, performance gains arising from this collaboration come at a price of increased complexity and coordination among involved network elements. An immediate question is how to adequately model a multicell cooperative network, while striking the balance between analytic complexity and precision of design decisions. In this article we highlight two categories of multicell network models, Wyner models and random network models, and their impact on the design and analysis of MCC systems. Recent examples of realistic yet tractable multicell network models are discussed.", "paper_title": "ON THE IMPACT OF NETWORK GEOMETRIC MODELS ON MULTICELL COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316195300012"}
