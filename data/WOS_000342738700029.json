In comparison with the original locality preserving projection (LPP) algorithm, the presented SLPP algorithm is able to simultaneously find the intrinsic manifold of facial feature vectors and deal with facial feature selection. This is realized by the use of L-1-norm regularization in the LPP objective fwiction, which is directly formulated as a least squares regression pattern. We use two real facial expression databases (JAFFE and Elcman's POFA) to testify the proposed SLPP method and certain experiments show that the proposed SLPP approach respectively gains 77.60% and 82.29% on JAFFE and POFA database.", "paper_title": "Facial Expression Recognition Based on Sparse Locality Preserving Projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700029"}
