In a spectral induced polarization survey, impedances are recorded at various frequencies. Both induced polarization and electromagnetic coupling effects occur simultaneously over the experimental frequency bandwidth, and these become progressively more dominant when the frequency increases. We used the CR1Dmod code published by Ingeman-Nielsen and Baumgartner [2006]. This code solves for electromagnetic responses, in the presence of complex resistivity effects in a 1 D Earth. In this paper, a homotopy method has been designed by the authors to overcome the local convergence problem of normal iterative methods. In addition, in order to further condition the inverse problem, we incorporated standard Gauss-Newton (or quasi-Newton) methods. Graphical user interfaces enable straightforward entering of the data and the a priori model, as well as the cable configuration. Two synthetic examples are presented, showing that the spectral parameters can be recovered from multifrequency, complex resistivity data. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
