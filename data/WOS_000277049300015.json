However, as their implementation details in commercial field-programmable gate arrays are not available to users, and the power estimates given by the tested low-level tool are not accurate enough to validate high-level models, the work on power estimation of these blocks is very limited. We present a dynamic power estimation methodology for the embedded multipliers in Xilinx Virtex-II Pro chips. The methodology is an adaptation of an existing power estimation method for lookup-table-based components and uses information about the type of architecture of the embedded block. The power model is characterized and verified by on-board measurements and is ready for integration with high-level power optimization techniques. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the model is higher than the average accuracy of the low-level commercial tool.", "paper_title": "Power Estimation of Embedded Multiplier Blocks in FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000277049300015"}
