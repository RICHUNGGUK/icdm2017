When this value is 1, the inter-distance constraint reduces to the all-different constraint. We introduce an algorithm to propagate this constraint and we show that, when variables domains are intervals, our algorithm achieves arc-B-consistency. It provides tighter bounds than generic scheduling constraint propagation algorithms (like edge-finding) that could be used to capture this constraint. The worst case complexity of the algorithm is cubic but it behaves well in practice and it drastically reduces the search space.
