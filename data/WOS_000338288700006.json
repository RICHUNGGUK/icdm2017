Maker's aim in this game is to build a large connected component, while Breaker's aim is to prevent him from doing so. For all values of Breaker's bias b, we determine whether Breaker wins (on any d-regular graph) or Maker wins (on almost every d-regular graph) and provide explicit winning strategies for both players. To this end, we prove an extension of a theorem of Gallai, Hasse, Roy and Vitaver about graph orientations without long directed simple paths.", "paper_title": "Component Games on Regular Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000338288700006"}
