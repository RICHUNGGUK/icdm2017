Traditional methods for improving business process modeling, such as workflow mining and process retrieval, still requires much manual work. To address this, based on the structure of a business process, a method called workflow recommendation technique is proposed in this paper to provide process designers with support for automatically constructing the new business process that is under consideration. In this paper, with the help of the minimum depth-first search (DFS) codes of business process graphs, we propose an efficient method for calculating the distance between process fragments and select candidate node sets for recommendation purpose. In addition, a recommendation system for improving the modeling efficiency and accuracy was implemented and its implementation details are discussed. At last, based on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we have conducted experiments to compare the proposed method with other methods and the experiment results proved its effectiveness for practical applications.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Recommendation Method for Improving Business Process Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600049"}
