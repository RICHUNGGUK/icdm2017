The algorithm closely follows standard branch and cut except for the definition of the lower and upper bounds and some optional speed-up mechanisms. It is applied to a routing problem called the multilabel traveling salesman problem, a variant of the traveling salesman problem in which labels are attributed to the edges. The goal is to find a Hamiltonian cycle that minimizes the tour length and the number of labels in the tour. Implementations of the generic multiobjective branch-and-cut algorithm and speed-up mechanisms are described. Computational experiments are conducted, and the method is compared to the classical is an element of-constraint method.", "paper_title": "A Generic Branch-and-Cut Algorithm for Multiobjective Optimization Problems: Application to the Multilabel Traveling Salesman Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000310834700004"}
