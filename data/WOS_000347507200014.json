This is particularly useful when the individual manipulator Jacobians are given, such that one would not need to derive an entirely new expression of a relative Jacobian but will only use the existing manipulator Jacobians and perform the necessary transformations. In this work, the final result reveals a wrench transformation matrix which was not present in previous derivations, or was not explicitly expressed. The proposed Jacobian expression results in a simplified, more compact and intuitive form. It will be shown that the wrench transformation matrix is present in stationary as well as mobile combined manipulators. Simulation results show that at high angular end-effector velocities, the contribution of the wrench transformation matrix cannot be ignored. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
