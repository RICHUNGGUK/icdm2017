Using this algorithm, we derive upper bounds on the treewidth (resp. on the pathwidth) of the cartesian product of two graphs, expressed in terms of the treewidth (resp. pathwidth) and the size of the factor graphs. In the context of graph grammars and graph logic, we prove that the cartesian product of a class of graphs by a finite set of graphs preserves the property of being a context-free set, and that the cartesian product by a finite set of connected graphs preserves MS(1)-definability and MS(2)-definability. We also prove that the cartesian product of two MS(2)-definable classes of connected graphs is MS(2)-definable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
