Therefore signal coefficients can be sorted out according to the different correlation characteristics between signals and noise. In this paper, a contourlet based denoising algorithm using interscale correlations is proposed combined with thresholding functions. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the corresponding wavelet based method especially for the images containing many edges and fine textures.", "paper_title": "A new denoising method with contourlet transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300067"}
