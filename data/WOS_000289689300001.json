Existence of codes satisfying the Costello lower bound on the free distance within a random ensemble of woven graph codes based on s-partite, s-uniform hypergraphs is shown, where s depends only on the code rate. Simulation results for Viterbi decoding of woven graph codes are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Woven convolutional graph codes with large free distances", "paper_id": "WOS:000289689300001"}
