Previous research has demonstrated that e-Commerce is more complex than Internet technologies; thus, examining the two technologies simultaneously provides further insight into the influence of the IT itself on usage behavior. Using a framework that is theoretically grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and tested through TAM and the Graphic, Visualization, & Usability (GVU) Center's 10th WWW User Survey scale items, study results indicate that different factors drive the Internet and e-Commerce usage decision.", "paper_title": "A comparative examination of individual differences and beliefs on technology usage: gauging the role of it", "paper_id": "WOS:000248292900002"}
