These actions affect not only the likelihood that the customer takes the recommendations in a short-term but also the service provider's reputation in it long run because often more risky recommendations may provide more utility but failures have it negative impact to reputation. As different customers have different risk attitudes, they have different trade-off between the service providers' reputation and the recommendations' utilities. Therefore, the classical decision model considering only the utility is inadequate. We reconsider the problem of making recommendations from multiple perspectives, including also reputation and risk attitude. Based oil this model, we propose all action theory to explain how service providers can act effectively at the strategic, tactical, and operations level, particularly through personalized recommendations.
