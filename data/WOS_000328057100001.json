WSNs have been applied into almost all walks of life. However, in many special fields, network security is a basic and important factor which we must concern for. This paper introduces the key management scheme after analyzing the security threats of LEACH protocol. At the same time, we adopt several related mechanisms to protect the communication among the sensor nodes and the confidentiality of the data transmission. Also, we use the mixed multipath mechanism among the clusters to improve the security of the network and strengthen the intrusion tolerance.", "paper_title": "Resilient Multipath Routing Mechanism Based on Clustering with Intrusion Tolerance", "paper_id": "WOS:000328057100001"}
