It has been shown that the estimate accuracy of the searching-based MUSIC estimator strictly depends on the number of search grids used during the search process, which is time consuming and the required number of search grids is not clear to determine. In conjunction with the GSA-based optimization, the high resolution DOA estimation can be obtained; meanwhile the searching grid size is no need to know previously. In this letter, we firstly present a GSA-based DOA estimator with MUSIC criterion under high interferer-to-noise ratio circumstances. Second, for the purpose to increase the estimation accuracy, we also propose an improved GSA with adaptive multiple accelerations, which depend on Newton-Raphson method. Several computer simulations are provided for illustration and comparison.", "paper_title": "DOA Estimation Based on GSA for CDMA Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414100023"}
