First, H-infinity filtering under synchronous switching is investigated; however, the H-infinity filtering performance cannot be guaranteed when there exists asynchronous switching, which is shown in a numerical example in this article. We then consider asynchronous case. At first the totally asynchronous switching is considered, then by the results of synchronous and totally asynchronous case, H-infinity filtering under partially asynchronous switching is derived. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "H-infinity filtering for switched nonlinear systems under asynchronous switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000287649700006"}
