We will focus on the existence of a time-optimal solution, singularity of switching function, and number of switching. These inherent problems are considered because of their rich geometric properties. The sufficient condition for the existence of a time-optimal solution reveals the controllability of T-S fuzzy model that can be found by the generalized rank condition. The time- optimal controller can be found as the bang-bang type with a finite number of switching by applying the maximum principle. In the study of the singularity problem, we will focus on the switching function whenever it vanishes over a finite time interval. Finally, we show that the bounded number of switching can be found if the T-S model (also a nonlinear system) is solvable.", "paper_title": "Time-Optimal Control of T-S Fuzzy Models via Lie Algebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000268527100001"}
