We establish both upper and lower bounds on the distortion of embedding locally constrained metrics into various target spaces. Other aspects of locally constrained metrics are studied as well, in particular, how far are those metrics from general metrics.", "paper_title": "LOCAL VERSUS GLOBAL PROPERTIES OF METRIC SPACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000300892300011"}
