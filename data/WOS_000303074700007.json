This phenomenon may result in dangerous WCET underestimation. This paper presents results of our work on strategies for eliminating timing anomalies. These strategies are purely based on the modification of software, i.e., they do not require any changes to hardware. In order to eliminate the timing anomalies originating from the processor's out-of-order instruction pipeline, we explore different methods of inserting instructions in the program code that eliminate all but one alternative schedules for the dynamic instruction scheduler. We also present a software-only way to force predictability for a two bit saturating counter branch predictor.", "paper_title": "Code transformations to prevent timing anomalies", "paper_id": "WOS:000303074700007"}
