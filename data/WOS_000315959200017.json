Conditional diagnosability is a novel measure of diagnosability that adds the additional condition that any faulty set cannot contain all of the neighbors of any vertex in a system. This study investigates some topological properties of k-ary n-cubes, where k >= 4 and n >= 4, and shows that the conditional diagnosability of k-ary n-cubes under the comparison diagnosis model is 6n - 5.", "paper_title": "The Conditional Diagnosability of k-Ary n-Cubes under the Comparison Diagnosis Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000315959200017"}
