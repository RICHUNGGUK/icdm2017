PIO provides the flexibility to control the number of I/O tasks through data rearrangement to an I/O friendly decomposition. This flexibility enables reductions in per task memory usage and improvements in disk I/O performance versus a serial I/O approach. We illustrate the impact various features within PIO have on memory usage and disk I/O bandwidth on a Cray XT5 system.", "paper_title": "An application-level parallel I/O library for Earth system models", "paper_id": "WOS:000300839500005"}
