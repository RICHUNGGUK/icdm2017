By operating with the B-n group operators on the computational basis of states, entangled states are obtained with properties analogous to those of the 2-qubits Bell states. Tracing any qubit from the 3-qubits B-n entangled states, we get mixed states which are separable with zero concurrence, and correspondingly with only classical correlations. These properties are generalized to larger B-n entangled states (n > 3). The properties of the B-n entangled states are analyzed by the use of Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) decompositions.", "paper_title": "Entangled states implemented by B-n group operators, including properties based on HS decompositions, separability and concurrence", "paper_id": "WOS:000351137800003"}
