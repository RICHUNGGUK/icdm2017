In this paper, we focus on symmetries of order two, i. e., involutions. Let Inv(F)(C) subset of Sym(C) be the set of involutions that stabilize F pointwise. For linear 1-perfect codes, the possibilities for the number of fixed points |F| are given, establishing lower and upper bounds. For any m >= 2 and any value k between these bounds, inverted right perpendicular m/2 inverted left perpendicular <= k <= m - 1, linear 1-perfect codes of length n = 2(m) - 1 which have an involution that fixes |F| = 2(k) - 1 coordinates are constructed. Moreover, for any m >= 4, 1 <= r <= m - 1, and inverted right perpendicular m/2 inverted left perpendicular <= k <= m - 1, nonlinear 1-perfect codes of length n = 2(m) - 1 having rank n - m + r and an involution that fixes 2(k) - 1 coordinates are also constructed, except one case, when m >= 6 is even, r = m - 1 and k = m/2.", "paper_title": "Involutions in Binary Perfect Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738800023"}
