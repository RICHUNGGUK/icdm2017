This hardware/software co-design platform has been implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA using a high-level synthesis and can be used to realise and test complex algorithms for real-time image and video processing applications. The video interface blocks are done in Register Transfer Languages and can be configured using the MicroBlaze processor allowing the support of multiple video resolutions. The IVPP provides the required logic to easily plug-in the generated processing blocks without modifying the front-end (capturing video data) and the back-end (displaying processed output data). The IVPP can be a complete hardware solution for a broad range of real-time image/video processing applications including video encoding/decoding, surveillance, detection and recognition.", "paper_title": "Image and video processing platform for field programmable gate arrays using a high-level synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000314510000008"}
