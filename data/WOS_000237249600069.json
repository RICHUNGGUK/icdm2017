Anomaly detection is an approach of intrusion detection that constructs models of normal behavior of users or systems and detects the behaviors that deviate from the model. Monitoring the sequences of system calls generated during the execution of privileged programs has been known to be an effective means of anomaly detection. Finite automata have been recognized as an appropriate device to model normal behaviors of system call sequences. However, there have been several technical difficulties in constructing finite automata from sequences of system calls. We present our study on how to construct finite automata from system call sequences using genetic algorithms. The resulting system is shown to be very effective in detecting intrusions through various experiments.", "paper_title": "Construction of finite automata for intrusion detection from system call sequences by genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600069"}
