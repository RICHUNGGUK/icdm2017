Agent-based simulations (ABSs) have become the de facto tool for this purpose; however, they may be used and implemented in a variety of ways. This article reviews existing implementations of ABSs for large-scale emergency response, and presents a taxonomy classifying them by usage. Opportunities for improving ABS for large-scale emergency response are identified.", "paper_title": "Agent-Based Simulation for Large-Scale Emergency Response: A Survey of Usage and Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000312211700008"}
