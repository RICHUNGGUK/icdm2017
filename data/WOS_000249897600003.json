A statistical characterization of a waiting time, an end-to-end delay, and a goodput are derived analytically in terms of the arrival rates, the number of slaves, and the packet error rate (PER). For simplicity, half-symmetric piconet is assumed in this analysis. Both exhaustive and limited scheduling are considered. The analytic results are validated by simulations.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of single Bluetooth piconet in error-prone environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000249897600003"}
