The routing algorithm has the virtue of being executed by each node of the hypercube without knowing the state of the others nodes. The algorithm is also vertex and link-contention free. We show, using the proposed algorithm, that BPC permutations are arbitrarily routable in the considered communication model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
