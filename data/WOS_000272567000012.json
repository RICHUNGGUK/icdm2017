The algorithm of rough set model will be used to analyze samples obtained and in order to illustrate the method, we use some artificial data in this paper. As its application, we discuss public art and urban development. Also, the concept of the Creative City, proposed by Charles Landry, will be reviewed for urban innovators, policy makers. scientists and artists. City renaissance has played an increasingly important role in urban regeneration since the mid-1980s. However, recent developments have focused less on capital projects, and more on the arts activity to support community-led renewals. It is essential for researchers to pay more attention to the issue of the Creative City development. In this paper, the differentiation is examined whether the cities can be classified into a Creative City or not.", "paper_title": "A ROUGH SET APPROACH TO CLASSIFICATION AND ITS APPLICATION FOR THE CREATIVE CITY DEVELOPMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000272567000012"}
