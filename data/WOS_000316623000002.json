Compared with the use of a high-order scheme for all stages, we observe that the mixed-order scheme achieves comparable accuracy and convergence while providing a speed-up of a factor of two on mesh sizes of O(106107) tetrahedron. For calculations with significant adaptive mesh refinement, a more modest speed-up of 30% is obtained. Published 2012.
