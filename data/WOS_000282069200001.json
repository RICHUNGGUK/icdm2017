We prove the decidability of the reachability problem for a subclass of SDMTAs which assumes an unbounded knowledge, and we analyze the expressiveness of the model and the considered subclass. In particular, while SDMTAs can simulate a Turing machine, and hence the reachability problem is in general undecidable, the subclass for which reachability is decidable, when endowed with a concept of recognized language, accepts languages that are not regular. As an application, we model and analyze a variation of the Yahalom protocol.", "paper_title": "Reachability results for timed automata with unbounded data structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000282069200001"}
