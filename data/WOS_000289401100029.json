Different from the conventional genetic algorithm (GA), PSSE established the coevolution and the cooperation between symbiotic relationship and swarm intelligence. Moreover, due to the adoption of sexual selection and biological arms race, PSSE is easily added into a global optimum when solving multi-modal numerical optimization problems. In this novel algorithm, gene hierarchy and gene particle swarm (GPS) model are defined. Except for the prototype PSSE, two collocating strategies of inertia weight for PSSE-LTI (linear time invariant) and PSSE-NTI (nonlinear time invariant) are also considered when the genes lie on a different level of hierarchy. Four famous benchmark functions are used to test the performance. Simulation results show this algorithm can improve the performance significantly.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL PARTICLE SWARM-BASED SYMBIOTIC EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR A CLASS OF MULTI-MODAL FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100029"}
