The main idea behind caching is to store parts of the popular content in end-users' memory and leverage the locally stored content to reduce peak data rates. By jointly designing content placement and delivery mechanisms, recent works have shown order-wise reduction in transmission rates in contrast to traditional methods. In this paper, we consider the secure caching problem with the additional goal of minimizing information leakage to an external wiretapper. The fundamental cache memory versus transmission rate tradeoff for the secure caching problem is characterized. Rather surprisingly, these results show that security can be introduced at a negligible cost, particularly for large number of files and users. It is also shown that the rate achieved by the proposed caching scheme with secure delivery is within a constant multiplicative factor from the information-theoretic optimal rate for almost all parameter values of practical interest.", "paper_title": "Fundamental Limits of Caching With Secure Delivery", "paper_id": "WOS:000352560400012"}
