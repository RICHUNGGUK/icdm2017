Its purpose is to increase operational performance without system error or jam. And, recently, the Green IT/S (information technologies and systems) refer to processes that directly or indirectly address environmental sustainability in organizations. Green IT addresses energy consumption, reduces the bad productivity, and increases system operational efficiency using the computer. However, when the system experiences some problem or operational error, users (system operators or managers) often find it difficult to locate the jam position immediately and precisely. It is also difficult to know the cause of the jam and to manage jam information even after they read and find relevant error text in a repair manual for the system. This research proposes a method to efficiently manage jam status for manufacturing systems. For this purpose, a topic map was used. The topic model has topic types, associations, and occurrences, which relate to operational jam, system jam, and system components. All jam status information to support users is managed by XML specification, distinctly and efficiently.", "paper_title": "Cloud computing-based jam management for a manufacturing system in a Green IT environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000342454300005"}
