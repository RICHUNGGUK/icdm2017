We analyze the flow of both music and video, and then segment them into sequences of near-uniform flow. We extract features from the both video and music segments, and then find matching pairs. The granularity of the matching process can be adapted by extending the segmentation process to several levels. Our approach drastically reduces the skill required to make simple music videos.", "paper_title": "Automated music video generation using multi-level feature-based segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000261958500002"}
