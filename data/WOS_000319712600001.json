The multi-fiber extension of the recently proposed Shared-Per-Input-Wavelength (SPIW) scheme is compared against the multi-fiber Shared-Per-Node (SPN) scheme in terms of cost and performance for asynchronous traffic. In addition to using Markov chains and fixed-point iterations for modeling the mono-fiber case, a novel state aggregation technique is proposed to evaluate the packet loss in asynchronous multi-fiber scenario. The accuracy of the performance models is validated by comparison with simulations in a wide variety of scenarios with both balanced and imbalanced input traffic. The proposed analytical models are shown to remarkably capture the actual system behavior in all scenarios we tested. The adoption of multi-fiber interfaces is shown to achieve remarkable savings in the number of wavelength converters employed and their range. In addition, the SPIW solution allows to save, in particular conditions, a significant number of optical gates compared to the SPN solution. Indeed, SPIW allows, if properly dimensioned, potential complexity and cost reduction compared to SPN, while providing similar performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
