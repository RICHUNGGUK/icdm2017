In this study, an algorithm for comet assay analysis has been proposed, aiming to minimize user interaction and providing reproducible measurements. The algorithm comprises two-steps: (a) comet identification via Gaussian pre-filtering and morphological operators; (b) comet segmentation via fuzzy clustering. The algorithm has been evaluated using comet images from human leukocytes treated with a commonly used DNA damaging agent. A comparison of the proposed approach with a commercial system has been performed. Results show that fuzzy segmentation can increase overall sensitivity, giving benefits in bio-monitoring studies where weak genotoxic effects are expected.", "paper_title": "Automated segmentation of comet assay images using Gaussian filtering and fuzzy clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000303354700010"}
