Data was collected from sixty-eight students of a local university. The findings suggested that students were likely to accept weblog use as a course requirement if they perceived the activity to be useful for learning. The paper concludes with a discussion on design implications for educational digital libraries.", "paper_title": "Weblogs for higher education: Implications for educational digital libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500068"}
