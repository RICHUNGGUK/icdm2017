The method combines an implicit Lagrangian step with an explicit Eulerian advection step. Individual materials obey separate energy equations, fulfill general equations of state, and may possess different temperatures. Material volume is tracked using a piecewise linear volume-of-fluid method. An overshoot-free logically simple and economic material advection algorithm for cylinder coordinates is derived, in an algebraic formulation. New aspects arising in the case of more than two materials such as the material ordering strategy during transport are presented. One- and two-dimensional numerical examples are given.
