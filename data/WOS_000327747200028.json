Herein, we developed a comprehensive python package to emphasize the integration of chemoinformatics and bioinformatics into a molecular informatics platform for drug discovery. PyDPI (drug-protein interaction with Python) is a powerful python toolkit for computing commonly used structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequences, molecular descriptors of drug molecules from their topology, and protein-protein interaction and protein-ligand interaction descriptors. It computes 6 protein feature groups composed of 14 features that include 52 descriptor types and 9890 descriptors, 9 drug feature groups composed of 13 descriptor types that include 615 descriptors. In addition, it provides seven types of molecular fingerprint systems for drug molecules, including topological fingerprints, electro-topological state (E-state) fingerprints, MACCS keys, FP4 keys, atom pair fingerprints, topological torsion fingerprints, and Morgan/circular fingerprints. By combining different types of descriptors from drugs and proteins in different ways, interaction descriptors representing protein-protein or drug-protein interactions could be conveniently generated. These computed descriptors can be widely used in various fields relevant to chemoinformatics, bioinformatics, and chemogenomics.
