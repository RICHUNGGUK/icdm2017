Our method reconstructs the region of removal in two phases. Firstly, the gradient maps in the removed area are completed through a patch-based filling algorithm. After that, the image is reconstructed from the gradient maps by solving a Poisson equation. A new patch-matching criterion is developed in our approach to govern the completion of gradient maps. Both the gradient and the color information are incorporated in this new criterion, so a better image completion result is obtained. Several examples and comparisons are given at the end of the paper to demonstrate the performance of our gradient-based image completion approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
