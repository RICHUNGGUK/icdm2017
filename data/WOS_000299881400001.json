Also, it can be used to collect, exchange, and integrate knowledge. During an intermediary transaction, the product information involves design, production, marketing, as well as consumer feedback. However, it is rather difficult to integrate and share the knowledge coming from different stages of product development. In view of that, the service-oriented architecture (SOA) is employed to construct a design-centric, Web-intermediary, and knowledge-sharing platform (DWKSP). The platform integrates all the product samples belonging to different users. Moreover, the intermediary mechanism for product samples serves as the underlying infrastructure which communicates and transmits information. Through extensible markup language (XML) technology, different fields of knowledge are integrated into the programmed procedure of an Internet-mediated transaction (IMT). Such knowledge is closely connected with designing, manufacturing and marketing the product. In consequence, the knowledge accumulated during an IMT will be structurally preserved; later, it will be transmitted between the users' heterogeneous systems. As the specification files of the product are used uniformly, the goal of integrating heterogeneous data is achieved.", "paper_title": "Constructing an interoperable, design-centric, service-oriented and knowledge-sharing architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000299881400001"}
