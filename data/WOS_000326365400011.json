However, there has been very little research on how to help designers capture detailed design knowledge for reuse. As a result, most detailed design knowledge still has to remain in designers' memories as tacit knowledge, which can easily get lost due to oblivion or the mobility of designers. Therefore, this paper attempts to develop a part affordance-based approach for externalizing and capturing detailed design knowledge for effective reuse. It first introduces a part model for representing the detailed design-related information. Based on the relational theory for design, the concept, part affordance, is then employed to help designers externalize and capture various lifecycle factors that are implicit in a detailed design. Based on the affordance constraint axiom, a systematic approach is then proposed for deriving tacit design knowledge from captured part affordances through the analysis of extreme working situations. The proposed approach has been implemented as the Design Knowledge-Capturing System (DKCS). A fixture design case has been employed to illustrate the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
