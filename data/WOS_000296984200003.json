Not much research has been done to examine the successful adoption of digital object identifier systems. This study examines the success factors for the adoption of digital object identifier systems by extending DeLone and McLean's information systems success model. A large-scale field study targeting digital content providers in Korea was employed to empirically validate a research model. Data was collected from 120 respondents from 41 digital content providers. The results indicate that information quality is the strongest factor to influence organizational benefits through perceived usefulness and user satisfaction. The syndication efforts of digital content providers can be a moderator in the successful adoption of digital object identifier systems. This has implications for how practitioners can best communicate the features and benefits of digital object identifier systems and provides additional support for researchers to examine the underutilized construct of organizational benefit. Limitations of this study are discussed in addition to concluding remarks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
