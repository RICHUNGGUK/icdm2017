A year is divided into four seasons on the basis of the Penna model. We define the rules of death, reproduction, fishing and so on for fish. And \"closed fishing\" in China is introduced in this model. Then we discuss the population size of fish and the fishing products in the case of \"closed fishing\" or not. At last the conclusion is obtained that the policy will be significant if fishing intensity is in a certain range. And reducing fishing intensity is essential policy, and \"closed fishing\" is just an accessorial policy.", "paper_title": "The effect of \"closed fishing\" in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000251156900009"}
