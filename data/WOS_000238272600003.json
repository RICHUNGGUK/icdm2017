The model is a reduced version of a comprehensive more general one, and it relates to the specific case of a competing bipartisan political system. The model structure contains terms with localized interactions and mean field terms. In the first part of the paper the mathematical details of the model are recalled. In the second part the simulations are presented with reference to the various scenarios examined. Finally a discussion on research perspectives is formulated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
