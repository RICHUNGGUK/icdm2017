In our research, we leverage the modular distributed modeling (MDM) methodology to simulate the interaction of design components in an assembly. The major improvement we have made in the RD methodology is to extend it with the capabilities of incorporating remotely represented off-the-shelf components in design and simulation-based testing of a distributed assembly. The deliverable of our research is the RD-MDM platform, which is capable of automatically selecting intellectually protected off the shelf design components over the Internet, integrating these components in an assembly, running simulations for design testing, and publishing the approved design without disclosing the proprietary information.", "paper_title": "The routine design-modular distributed modeling platform for distributed routine design and simulation-based testing of distributed assemblies", "paper_id": "WOS:000252510400001"}
