We provide a deterministic algorithm to the Firing Squad Synchronization Problem, for digraph-based P systems, which runs in 3e + 11 steps, where e is the eccentricity of the general. Our algorithm uses a convenient framework, called simple P modules, which embraces the essential features of several popular types of P systems.", "paper_title": "Faster synchronization in P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300891600012"}
