This study develops a topological design method of surface electrode distribution over piezoelectric sensors/actuators attached to a thin-walled shell structure for reducing the sound radiation in an unbounded acoustic domain. In the optimization model, the sound pressure norm at specific reference points under excitations at a certain excitation frequency or in a given frequency range is taken as the objective function. The pseudo densities for indicating absence and presence of surface electrodes at each element are taken as the design variables, and a penalized relationship between the densities and the active damping effect is employed. The vibrating structure is discretized with finite element model for the frequency response analysis and the sound radiation analysis in the unbounded acoustic domain is treated by boundary element method. The applied voltage on each actuator is determined by the constant gain velocity feedback (CGVF) control law. The technique of the complex mode superposition in the state space, in conjunction with a model reduction transformation, is adopted in the response analysis of the system characterized by a non-proportional active damping property. In this context, the adjoint-variable sensitivity analysis scheme is derived. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by numerical examples, and several key factors on the optimal designs are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of electrode coverage of piezoelectric thin-walled structures with CGVF control for minimizing sound radiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344544700006"}
