By assigning different components of the quadrature signaling to different cooperative users and letting each user node decide whether to relay information for the other in the assigned component based on a threshold or not, independently, the TQS scheme effectively integrated the advantages of both quadrature signaling and threshold techniques. The authors investigate the end-to-end bit error rate (BER) performance and obtain its closed-form expression. According to our theoretical analysis, the TQS scheme can enhance the diversity gain of a cooperative system and, meanwhile, reduce the complexity of its implementation to a great extent. In addition, the communication system, using TQS scheme, has the feature of easily switching between cooperative and non-cooperative patterns. Finally, the numerical and simulation results show that the scheme has excellent performance as expected.", "paper_title": "A novel threshold-based quadrature signaling scheme for cooperative networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339228800003"}
