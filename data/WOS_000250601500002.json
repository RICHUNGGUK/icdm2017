An understanding of the fundamental mechanical performance of concrete must therefore be embedded in a stochastic framework. The current work attempts to address the connection between a two-dimensional concrete mesostructure and the random local material properties associated within that mesostructure. This work builds on previous work that has focused on the random configuration of concrete mesostructures. This was accomplished by developing an understanding of the effects of variations in the mortar strength and the mortar-aggregate interfacial strength in given deterministic mesostructural configurations. The results are assessed through direct tension tests that are validated by comparing experimental results of two different, pre-arranged mesostructures, with the intent of isolating the effect of local variations in strength. Agreement is shown both in mechanical property values as well as the qualitative nature of crack initiation and propagation.", "paper_title": "Modeling mesoscale uncertainty for concrete in tension", "paper_id": "WOS:000250601500002"}
