Here we present a database named Xeno-glycomics database (XDB) that contains cell-or tissue-specific pig glycomes analyzed with mass spectrometry-based techniques, including a comprehensive pig glycan information on chemical structures, mass values, types and relative quantities. It was designed as a user-friendly web-based interface that allows users to query the database according to pig tissue/cell types or glycan masses. This database will contribute in providing qualitative and quantitative information on glycomes characterized from various pig cells/organs in xenotransplantation and might eventually provide new targets in the alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase gene-knock out pigs era.", "paper_title": "The Xeno-glycomics database (XDB): a relational database of qualitative and quantitative pig glycome repertoire", "paper_id": "WOS:000326643600025"}
