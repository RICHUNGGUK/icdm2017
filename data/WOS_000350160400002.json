A power of C may quickly fill the whole space. Our purpose is to answer the following question: does the square of a code typically fill the whole space? We give a positive answer, for codes of dimension k and length roughly (1/2) k(2) or smaller. Moreover, the convergence speed is exponential if the difference k(k+1)/2-n is at least linear in k. The proof uses random coding and combinatorial arguments, together with algebraic tools involving the precise computation of the number of quadratic forms of a given rank, and the number of their zeros.", "paper_title": "Squares of Random Linear Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000350160400002"}
