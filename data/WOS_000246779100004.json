Contribution considers two problems: how to innovate information support for business with non-technological innovations? And how can enterprises improve reliability of information for their work? Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, qualitative analysis on the basis of the dialectical systems theory and business cybernetics is applied. Findings - Modem markets require innovated business concepts. They include creation and implementation of requisitely holistic information support. Hence, enterprises need information management innovation. The use of requisite holism (as non-technical innovation) to increase content-reliability of business information is discussed. Matching information requirements by business cybemetics based on dialectical systems thinking can diminish errors by providing requisite holism. Research limitations/implications - Research is limited to three hypotheses and qualitative analysis in desk research. Practical experience is considered indirectly. Practical implications - The habit of limiting business information to financial information or marketing information separately as well as the habit of discussing mostly or even only, information reliability from technical support viewpoints, is attacked. An alternative is suggested. Originality/value - The available literature does not provide for a similar model of how to provide information that is reliable in terms of its contents by matching Mulej/Kajzer's law of requisite holism.", "paper_title": "Requisite holism - precondition of reliable business information", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779100004"}
