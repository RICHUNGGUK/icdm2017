In this sense, finite element (FE) simulation coupled with experiment could be a valuable tool to provide a better understanding of the behaviour of internal organs under crash conditions. This work proposes a methodology based on inverse analysis which combines exploration process optimisation and robustness study to obtain mechanical behaviour of the complex structure of the liver through FE simulation. The liver characterisation was based on Mooney-Rivlin hyperelastic behaviour law considering whole liver structure under uniform quasi-static compression. With the global method used, the model fits experimental data. The variability induced by modelling parameters is quantified within a reasonable time.", "paper_title": "Inverse analysis and robustness evaluation for biological structure behaviour in FE simulation: application to the liver", "paper_id": "WOS:000306745900010"}
