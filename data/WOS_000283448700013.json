The degree of survivability is usually governed by the data transfer mechanism or protocol that delivers data from source to destination. In this article we survey and discuss a variety of survivability issues, challenges, and mechanisms in multihop wireless networks. Unlike some previous surveys, we do not focus only on multipath routing techniques. We try to cover a broader spectrum of survivability techniques in the literature. Moreover, we discuss new directions in survivability that use the network coding technique in order to achieve a better degree of scalability, which is usually an issue in most survivability techniques, especially in wireless networks.", "paper_title": "SURVIVABILITY STRATEGIES IN MULTIHOP WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000283448700013"}
