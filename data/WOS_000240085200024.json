This paper introduces classification ontology into WWW information integration to solve the semantic combination problem of heterogeneity classification architecture in Web information integration. However, there may be many kinds of ontology in a specific domain due to the structure of the websites, domain experts and different goals. So we have to combine all these kinds of ontology into logically unified integrated classification ontology in order to solve the problem of semantic heterogeneity commendably. This paper primarily discusses the method of building integrated classification ontology based on individual ontology, presents the definition of classification ontology, analyses the conceptual mapping and relational mapping between ontologies and solves the level conflict in the equivalent concepts.", "paper_title": "WWW information integration oriented classification ontology integrating approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200024"}
