Trust evaluation is achieved by means of behavioral analysis, in such way that different access policies can be automatically selected whenever a user behavior is validated. Behavioral analysis uses machine-learning techniques to gain knowledge about user past navigation paths, creating a user signature to be compared against the current behavior of that user. An enhanced version of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm is used to quantify the behavioral analysis (trust calculation), incorporating a way to weigh in the presence of identical subsequences within two distinct navigation paths. This approach is validated through an experimental evaluation which confirmed that the proposed enhanced Levenshtein Distance technique promotes better results.", "paper_title": "Enhancing levenshtein distance algorithm for assessing behavioral trust", "paper_id": "WOS:000293548200001"}
