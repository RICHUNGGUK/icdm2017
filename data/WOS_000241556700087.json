A frequently used registration method is based on manually or automatically derived point landmarks leading to a sparse displacement field which is densified in a thin-plate spline (TPS) framework. A large problem of TPS interpolation/approximation is the requirement for evenly distributed landmark correspondences over the data set which can rarely be guaranteed by landmark matching algorithms. We propose to overcome this problem by combining the sparse correspondences with intensity-based registration in a generic nonlinear registration scheme based on the calculus of variations. Missing landmark information is compensated by a stronger intensity term, thus combining the strengths of both approaches. An explicit formulation of the generic framework is derived that constrains an intra-modality intensity data term with a regularization term from the corresponding landmarks and an anisotropic image-driven displacement regularization term. An evaluation of this algorithm is performed comparing it to an intensity- and a landmark-based method. Results on four synthetically deformed and four clinical thorax CT data sets at different breathing states are shown.", "paper_title": "Automatic point landmark matching for regularizing nonlinear intensity registration: Application to thoracic CT images", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700087"}
