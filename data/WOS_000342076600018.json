Useful knowledge discovery from Web usage data and satisfactory knowledge representation for effective Web-page recommendations are crucial and challenging. This paper proposes a novel method to efficiently provide better Web-page recommendation through semantic-enhancement by integrating the domain and Web usage knowledge of a website. Two new models are proposed to represent the domain knowledge. The first model uses an ontology to represent the domain knowledge. The second model uses one automatically generated semantic network to represent domain terms, Web-pages, and the relations between them. Another new model, the conceptual prediction model, is proposed to automatically generate a semantic network of the semantic Web usage knowledge, which is the integration of domain knowledge and Web usage knowledge. A number of effective queries have been developed to query about these knowledge bases. Based on these queries, a set of recommendation strategies have been proposed to generate Web-page candidates. The recommendation results have been compared with the results obtained from an advanced existing Web Usage Mining (WUM) method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces significantly higher performance than the WUM method.", "paper_title": "Web-Page Recommendation Based on Web Usage and Domain Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000342076600018"}
