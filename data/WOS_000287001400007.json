Before the launch, a nominal path and the corresponding nominal control law for the entire journey are computed. For each sampling instant during the guided flight, a linear equation approximately relating the differences between the actual and nominal values is considered, and a Least-Squares formula using data from on-line state measurements is applied to compute the actual control. The coefficient matrices of the Least-Squares formula can be determined by off-line computations. The method enjoys simplicity of implementation by onboard computers, as well as robust accuracy against strong winds and uncertainties in thrust magnitude.", "paper_title": "An Accurate Guidance Algorithm for Implementation Onboard Satellite Launch Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000287001400007"}
