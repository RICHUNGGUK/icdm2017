We present efficient implementation strategies for FFT-based dense polynomial multiplication targeting multi-cores. We show that balanced input data can maximize parallel speedup and minimize cache complexity for bivariate multiplication. However, unbalanced input data, which are common in symbolic computation, are challenging. We provide efficient techniques, that we call contraction and extension, to reduce multivariate (and univariate) multiplication to balanced bivariate multiplication. Our implementation in Cilk++ demonstrates good speedup on multi-cores", "paper_title": "BALANCED DENSE POLYNOMIAL MULTIPLICATION ON MULTI-CORES", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753200004"}
