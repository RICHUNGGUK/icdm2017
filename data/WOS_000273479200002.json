A remarkable characteristic of the system is its ability to track several targets while they group and split, without using 3D information. Thus, special attention is given to the feature-selection and appearance-computation modules, and to those modules involved in tracking through groups. The system aims to work as a stand-alone application in complex and dynamic scenarios. No a-priori knowledge about either the scene or the targets, based on a previous training period, is used. Hence, the scenario is completely unknown beforehand. Successful tracking has been demonstrated in well-known databases of both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Accurate and robust localisations have been yielded during long-term target merging and occlusions.", "paper_title": "On tracking inside groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000273479200002"}
