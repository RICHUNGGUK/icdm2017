The traditional handling based on work line is converted into pool strategy, namely loading and unloading containers with multiple work lines are operating simultaneously. In the paper we discuss the yard crane scheduling problem with multiple work lines in container terminals. We develop a multi-objective 0-1 integer programming model considering the minimum total completion time of all yard cranes and the maximization balanced distribution of the completion time at the same time. With the application of adaptive weight GA approach, the problem can be solved by a multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm and the Pareto solutions can be finally got. Using the compromised approach, the nearest feasible solution to ideal solution is chosen to be the best compromised Pareto optimal solution of the multi-objective model. The numerical example proves the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method to the multi-objective yard crane scheduling problem.", "paper_title": "A multi-objective genetic algorithm for yard crane scheduling problem with multiple work lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800013"}
