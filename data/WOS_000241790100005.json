To investigate how the firing properties of single neurons affect to ensemble rhythmic activities in neural networks, we constructed different types of neural networks whose excitatory neurons are the Class I neurons or the Class II neurons. The networks were driven by random inputs and developed with STDP learning. As a result, the Class I and the Class II neural networks generate different types of rhythmic activities: the Class I neural network generates slow rhythmic activities, and the Class II neural network generates fast rhythmic activities.", "paper_title": "Self-organizing rhythmic patterns with spatio-temporal spikes in class I and class II neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100005"}
