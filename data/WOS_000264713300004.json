In this paper, G2 is used to compute the drag coefficient c(D) for the flow Past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number Re=3900, for which the flow is turbulent. It is found that it is possible to approximate c(D) to an accuracy of a few percent, corresponding to the accuracy in experimental results for this problem, using less than 10(5) mesh points, which makes the simulations possible using a standard PC. The mesh adaptively refined until a stopping criterion is reached with respect to the error in a chosen output of interest, which in this paper is c(D). Both the stopping criterion and the mesh-refinement strategy are based on a posteriori error estimates, in the form of a space-time integral of residuals times derivatives of the solution of it dual problem, linearized at the approximate solution, and with data coupling to the output of interest.
