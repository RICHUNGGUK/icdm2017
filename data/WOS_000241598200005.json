This exploratory stage of research investigates scalability of both lane-changing and car-following behavior. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to create a reduced-scale network (microcosm) that retains most of the significant characteristics of the full-scale network (prototype). To achieve this objective a systematic downsampling procedure has been applied to a case study of a one-lane homogeneous freeway corridor in order to create a geometrically, kinematically, and behaviorally equivalent microcosm environment. This paper examines the scalability of lane-changing behavior, assuming a shifted negative exponential headway distribution, and investigates the scalability of car-following behavior under various operating conditions and downsampling ratios. The paper focuses on the tradeoff between performance and scalability of microscopic simulation systems. For each of the 48 cases considered, optimal behavioral parameters were determined based on two optimization methods: (1) Microscopic based on minimization of trajectory errors in both environments and (2) macroscopic derived from minimization of density errors in both environments throughout the simulation period. The results show that both optimization solutions were consistent in determining the optimal behavioral parameters.", "paper_title": "Potential computational benefits of geometric, kinematic, and behavioral downsampling of microscopic traffic network simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598200005"}
