The topology of the LTW has been specified, based upon which the impacts of US financial crisis on the structural and behavior pattern of the LTW are further investigated. The major findings are given as follows. Firstly, the LTW is much more integrated than the global trade web; secondly, after the financial crisis, the fundamental structure of the network remains relatively stable but the strength of the web has been changed and the structure of the web has evolved over time. Economic implications for what have been observed are also discussed.", "paper_title": "THE TOPOLOGY OF A LOCAL TRADE WEB AND IMPACTS OF THE US FINANCIAL CRISIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281399800001"}
