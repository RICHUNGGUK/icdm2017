This forwarding scheme is prone to cause unfair load distribution and further lead to network congestion, overlooked in the previous work. In this paper, we discuss the network congestion from a community perspective and take it into account the design of message forwarding algorithms. We first put forward a novel distributed community detection approach, which could track the evolution of communities. Based on the identified communities, we develop a congestion avoidance mechanism to divert the load away from the congested areas to the alternative custodians and further present a congestion-aware message forwarding algorithm where messages can avoid being transmitted to the congested nodes. We finally evaluate the effectiveness of distributed community detection and congestion-aware message forwarding through the extensive real-trace driven simulations.
