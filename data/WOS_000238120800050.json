We name the algorithm Sub-optimal Model Predictive Control Scheduler (SMPCS). The SMPCS prepares a platform to guarantee end to end proportional delay in DiffServ architecture. This paper investigates the complication of SMPCS and its implementation problems in high speed routers. In order to efficiently implement the controller we admit sub-optimal results against reduction in the complexity of the optimizer. Simulation results show that the proposed approximation improves speed of the controller considerably.", "paper_title": "SMPCS: Sub-optimal model predictive control scheduler", "paper_id": "WOS:000238120800050"}
