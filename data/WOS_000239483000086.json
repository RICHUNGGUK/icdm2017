First, we develop an unsupervised learning procedure based upon the adaptive recursive algorithm. Here, each 2D training image is mapped into the associated ID wavelet in the least-squares sense during the training phase. Second, we show how the recall procedure minimizes the recognition errors with a competitive network in the hidden layer. As the images corrupted by noises are applied to an associative cube, the nearest one among the original training images would be retrieved in the sense of the minimum Euclidean squared norm during the recall phase. The simulation results confirm the robustness of associative cubes even if the test data are heavily distorted by noises.", "paper_title": "Associative cubes in unsupervised learning for robust gray-scale image recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000086"}
