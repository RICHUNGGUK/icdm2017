This study addresses this gap by incorporating the nature and purpose of the IT artifact in terms of four characteristics: utilitarian value, hedonic value. communication value, and technical complexity. The moderating effects of these characteristics on individual-level IT usage were tested using a meta-analysis method. Our findings demonstrate how incorporating such variables can provide a richer and more nuanced understanding of IT usage than that offered by generic models of IT usage.", "paper_title": "LOOKING INSIDE THE \"IT BLACK BOX\": TECHNOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON IT USAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000332186900001"}
