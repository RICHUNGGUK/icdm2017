Although a number of certificateless signatures and certificate-based signatures from bilinear pairings have been proposed, their lattice-based counterparts still remain unrealized. In this paper, we present the first constructions of certificateless signature and certificate-based signature from lattices. Both constructions are proven to be secure in the random oracle model under conventional small integer solution assumption that is as hard as approximating several standard lattice problems.
