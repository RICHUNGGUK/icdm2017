Recently, there is growing interest for supporting RE as a network-wide service. Such a network-wide RE service benefits ISPs by reducing link loads and increasing the effective network capacity to better accommodate the increasing number of bandwidth-intensive applications. Further, a networkwide RE service democratizes the benefits of RE to all end-to-end traffic and improves application performance by increasing throughput and reducing latencies. While the vision of a network-wide RE service is appealing, realizing it in practice is challenging. In particular, extending single-vantage-point RE solutions designed for enterprise access links to the network-wide case is inefficient and/or requires modifying routing policies. We present SmartRE, a practical and efficient architecture for network-wide RE. We show that SmartRE can enable more effective utilization of the available resources at network devices, and thus can magnify the overall benefits of network-wide RE. We prototype our algorithms using Click and test our framework extensively using several real and synthetic traces.", "paper_title": "SmartRE: An Architecture for Coordinated Network-wide Redundancy Elimination", "paper_id": "WOS:000271210500009"}
