This article proposes critical success factors for electronic health record adoption based on a comprehensive literature review and prescriptive analysis. The proposed 26 critical success factors for electronic health records are of value to both practice and research: practitioners are offered guidance with regard to managing electronic health record implementations toward adoption success, while researchers are offered a basis for further research about electronic health record implementation and adoption.", "paper_title": "Critical Success Factors for Adoption of Electronic Health Record Systems: Literature Review and Prescriptive Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000345238800003"}
