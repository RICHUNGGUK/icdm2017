Several techniques have been proposed so far to interconnect nanomachines. For short distances (nm-mm ranges), researchers are proposing to use molecular motors and calcium signaling. For long distances (mm-m), pheromones are envisioned to transport information. In this work we propose a new mechanism for medium-range communications (nm-mu m): flagellated bacteria. This technique is based on the transport of DNA-encoded information between emitters and receivers by means of a bacterium. We present a physical channel characterization and a simulator that, based on the previous characterization, simulates the transmission of a DNA packet between two nanomachines.
