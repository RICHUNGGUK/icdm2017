This new method can be extended to high-dimensional cases, such as the B-spline proposal in Gibbs sampling and in the Hit-and-Run (BSPHR) algorithm. It improves the proposal distribution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by carrying more information from the target function. The performance of BSPHR was compared with that of other Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers in simulation and real data examples. Simulation results show that the new method performs significantly better than other MCMC methods. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
