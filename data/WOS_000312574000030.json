We compare these bounds, and for each bound give explicit examples where that bound is the best; thus showing that no one bound is universally better than the others. In the second part of the paper we give several concrete examples of factorizations where the factors have \"unexpectedly\" large coefficients. These examples help us understand why the bounds must be larger than you might expect, and greatly extend the collection published by Collins. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
