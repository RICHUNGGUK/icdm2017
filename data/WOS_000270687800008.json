We also extend these algorithms for optimal and sub-optimal reconciliations according to the three usual combinatorial costs (duplication, loss, and mutation). Applying these algorithms to simulated and real gene family evolutionary scenarios, we observe that the LCA (Last Common Ancestor) based reconciliation is almost always identical to the real one.", "paper_title": "Space of Gene/Species Trees Reconciliations and Parsimonious Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000270687800008"}
