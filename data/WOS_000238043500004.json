Most existing algorithms for rotation computation are shown to work only on synthetic data. The problems arisen from real image data are discussed and solved in our proposed system. Currently, we are capable of computing two rotational parameters of a moving observer given the translational velocity in real-time from a live image sequence. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
