The proposed scheme finds the solutions of nonlinear problems without any discretization, restrictive assumptions and avoids the rounding-off errors. The proposed technique solves the nonlinear problems without using Adomian polynomials and He's polynomials which can be considered as a clear advantage of this new algorithm over decomposition and the homotopy perturbation transform method (HPTM). A good agreement between the obtained solution and some well-known results has been demonstrated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
