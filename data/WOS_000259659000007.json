The Proposed algorithm is composed of two phases: the occlusion detection phase and the selective LNMF-based recognition phase. We use a local approach to effectively detect partial occlusions in an input face image. A face image is first divided into a finite number of disjointed local patches, and then each patch is represented by PCA (Principal Component Analysis), obtained by corresponding occlusion-free patches of training images. And the 1-NN threshold classifier is used for occlusion detection for each patch in the corresponding PCA space. In the recognition phase, by employing the LNMF-based face representation, we exclusively use the LNMF bases of occlusion-free image patches for face recognition. Euclidean nearest neighbor rule is applied for the matching. We have performed experiments on AR face database that includes many occluded face images by sunglasses and scarves. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed local patch-based occlusion detection technique works well and the S-LNMF method shows superior performance to other conventional approaches.
