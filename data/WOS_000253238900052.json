It enables a purchaser to do single sourcing and multiple sourcing by calculating a combined supplier score (CSS), which accounts for both qualitative and quantitative factors that impact on supply chain performance. By performing a cluster analysis, it draws a supplier map (SM) so as to position suppliers within the qualitative and quantitative dimensions of performance efficiency, and to select a portfolio of suppliers from supplier segments, which are different in performance with regard to key factors.
