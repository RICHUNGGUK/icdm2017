This paper, therefore, translates constructs associated with T2 fuzzy sets to the language of functions on spaces. Such translations may encourage researchers in different disciplines to investigate T2 fuzzy sets, thereby potentially broadening their application and strengthening the underlying theory.", "paper_title": "Type-2 Fuzzy Sets as Functions on Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000283547400015"}
