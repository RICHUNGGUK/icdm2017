We then extend it to an H-infinity controller synthesis for systems with polytopic uncertainty. All conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). In some previous descriptor system methods, the products of the controller and Lyapunov matrices are completely separated for the performance analysis, but not for controller synthesis - the method developed in the current paper eliminates this weakness. We present a numerical example to illustrate the effectiveness of the solution.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent robust H-infinity control for neutral time-delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000343644100009"}
