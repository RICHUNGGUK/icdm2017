A critical problem in importance sampling on Bayesian networks is the selection of a good importance function to sample a network's prior and posterior probability distribution. The initially optimal importance functions eventually start deviating from the optimal function when sampling a network's posterior distribution given evidence, even when adaptive methods are used that adjust an importance function to the evidence by learning. In this article we propose a new family of Refractor Importance Sampling (RIS) algorithms for adaptive importance sampling under evidential reasoning. RIS applies \"arc refractors\" to a Bayesian network by adding new arcs and refining the conditional probability tables. The goal of RIS is to optimize the importance function for the posterior distribution and reduce the error variance of sampling. Our experimental results show a significant improvement of RIS over state-of-the-art adaptive importance sampling algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
