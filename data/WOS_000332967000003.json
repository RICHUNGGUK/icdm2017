In this paper, a queueing model to analyze the performances of the secondary users in a cognitive radio network is presented. The queueing model considers the transmissions of a secondary system where a Medium Access Control algorithm is used to enable the secondary users to sense and access the channels. Also, a simple scheduler is employed to assign transmission time slots to the secondary users. Because the value of the system parameters can be perturbed and cannot be determined precisely, the analysis is extended to take uncertainty into account. In this case, a robust optimization method to study the Markov chain with uncertainty is applied to obtain the stationary probabilities of the queueing model under uncertainty. The lower and upper bounds of performance measures are obtained and compared with the nominal value.
