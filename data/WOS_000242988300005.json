Resource allocation and call admission control (CAC) are key management functions in future 3G and 4G cellular networks. in order to provide multimedia applications to mobile users with QoS guarantees and efficient resource utilization. There are two main strategies for radio resource allocations in cellular wireless networks known as complete partitioning (CP) and complete sharing (CS). In this paper, theses strategies are extended for operation in 3G and beyond network. First, two CS-based call admission controls, referred to herein as queuing priority call admission control (QP-CAC) and hybrid priority call admission control (HP-CAC), and one CP-based call admission control referred to as complete partitioning call admission control (CP-CAC) are presented. Then, this study proposes a novel dynamic procedure, referred to as the dynamic prioritized uplink call admission control (DP-CAC) designed to overcome the shortcomings of CS and CP-based CACs. Results indicate the superiority of DP-CAC as it is able to achieve a better balance between system utilization. revenue, and quality of service provisioning. CS-based algorithms achieve the best system utilization and revenue at the expense of serious unfairness for the traffic classes with diverse QoS requirements. DP-CAC manages to attain equal system utilization and revenue to CS-based algorithms without the drawbacks in terms of fairness and service differentiation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
