Results of this method are independent of a specific model type and can be used to estimate the most appropriate model (structural index). This paper presents a grid implementation of the SLUTH method to visualise both depth and structural index from magnetic anomaly data. The implementation uses the Geosoft GX programming language. The method has been tested using theoretical magnetic gridded data and two methods have been used for estimating depth; the estimate from the width of the imaged feature gives an underestimate and the estimate from the rate of fall off of the field with height gives an overestimate. The practical utility of the algorithm is demonstrated using field data from the Saskatoon area of Canada. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
