The problem is NP-hard, which causes exact solutions to require an intractable running time in the worst case. E-approximation algorithms provide a guaranteed approximate solution for all inputs while incurring a tractable (i.e., polynomial) computation time. This paper presents a performance evaluation of these two types of algorithms. The main performance criteria are accuracy and speed.", "paper_title": "A comparison of exact and epsilon-approximation algorithms for constrained routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800017"}
