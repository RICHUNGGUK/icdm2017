The first step in developing the Q-KE-CLD tool involved collecting and analyzing print defect descriptions in Korean and English. A fuzzy Bayesian model was obtained from the descriptions and the Q-KE-CLD tool was developed. The tool was then experimentally evaluated in four different universities in South Korea. Results showed that Korean subjects generated Korean queries faster (p = 0.008) when entering Korean queries. In addition, the subjects rated Korean queries as being easier to generate (p = 0.004). Untrained subjects reported that use of the Korean language made it easier to generate queries and identify print defects. The overall results suggested that query translation-based cross-language diagnosis is a feasible approach for localizing troubleshooting websites. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
