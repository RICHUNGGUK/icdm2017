However, despite their power, contextual grammars do not provide a structural description of the generated languages. We present several modalities to add structures to classical contextual grammars. We are studying the relations of these structured contextual languages comparing with other structured languages. Several examples show the potential of the newly introduced grammars.", "paper_title": "Trees as contexts in formal language generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400071"}
