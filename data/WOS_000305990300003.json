Different LGP, MLP and FL models are developed for estimating the 5- and 30-min traffic flow rates. New LGP- and MLP-based prediction equations are derived for the traffic flow rates in the 5- and 30-min time intervals. The models are established upon extensive databases of the traffic flow records obtained from Iran's Rasht-Qazvin highway. The results indicate that the proposed models are effectively capable of predicting the target values. The LGP-based models are found to be simple, straightforward and more practical for predictive purposes compared with the other derived models.", "paper_title": "A computational intelligence-based approach for short-term traffic flow prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000305990300003"}
