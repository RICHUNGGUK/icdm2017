In particle accelerators the beam must be guided and focused using bending magnets and magnetic lenses, respectively. The alignment of the lenses along a transport line aims to ensure that the beam passes through their optical axes and represents a critical point in the assembly of the machine. There are more and more accelerators in the world, many of which are very small machines. Because the existing literature and programs are mostly targeted for large machines. in this work we describe a method suitable for small machines. This method consists in determining statistically the alignment tolerance in a set of lenses. Differently from the methods used in standard simulation codes for particle accelerators, the statistical method we propose makes it possible to evaluate particle losses as a function of the alignment accuracy of the optical elements in a transport line. Results for 100 key electrons, on the 3.5-m long conforming beam stage of the IFUSP Microtron are presented as an example of use. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
