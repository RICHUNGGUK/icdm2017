Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) can be used to specify process choreography, which helps into modeling service compositions. However, from a BPMN choreography diagram it is difficult to actually obtain an executable model that fulfills the mobility requirements that are present in the ubiquitous systems. In this paper, it is proposed a Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) approach to transform a BPMN choreography model into software templates for ubiquitous systems, adopting specific target platforms (programming languages, middleware, etc.). A set of CASE tools have been implemented to assist in the specification and transformation processes.", "paper_title": "A model-driven approach to service composition on the basis of the specification of BPMN choreographies", "paper_id": "WOS:000350712700007"}
