To verify the proposed method, we have conducted FE analyses for two cases of subsoil, one is a subsoil having only one homogeneous clay layer, and the other one is a subsoil having two clay layers. The analyzed results showed that the effects of both well resistance (in the vertical drain) and smear zone (around the vertical drain) are satisfactorily modeled by the proposed plane strain unit cell in both cases.
