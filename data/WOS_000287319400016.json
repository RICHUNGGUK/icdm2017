As those circuits are vulnerable to power supply noises, switching noises and environmental variations, they lead to a reliability issue such as time-varying or metastable responses. To resolve this issue, this letter proposes a new integrated circuit design for PUFs using differential amplifiers. The feasibility of the proposed circuit has been theoretically analyzed and validated through HSPICE simulations for the previous and proposed circuits.", "paper_title": "Integrated circuit design for physical unclonable function using differential amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000287319400016"}
