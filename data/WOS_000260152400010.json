This study intends to propose a fuzzy AprioriSome algorithm for fuzzy sequential patterns mining with integration with clustering technique, K-means algorithm. Two experiments performed using transaction data provided by a securities firm and foodmarket data from SQL sever 2000 demonstrate the strength of fuzzy AprioriSome sequential pattern mining in mining large quantity of transaction data.
