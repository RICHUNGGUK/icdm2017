This paper focuses on the neuron's behaviors in an area of brain. Our model could regenerate the power-law behaviors and finite size effects of neural avalanche. The probability density functions (PDFs) for the neural avalanche size differing at different times (lattice size) have fat tails with a q-Gaussian shape and the same parameter value of q in the thermodynamical limit. Above two kinds of behaviors show that our neural model can well present self-organized critical behavior. The robustness of PDFs shows the stability of self-organized criticality. Meanwhile, the avalanche scaling relation of the waiting time has been found.", "paper_title": "A SIMPLE NEURON NETWORK BASED ON HEBB'S RULE", "paper_id": "WOS:000293854100008"}
