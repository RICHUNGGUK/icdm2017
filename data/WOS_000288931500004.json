The main results below include a proof that any high total e-degree below 0'(e) is splittable over any low e-degree below it, a non-cupping result in the high enumeration degrees which occurs at a low level of the Ershov hierarchy, and a empty set'''-priority construction of a Pi(0)(1)e-degree unsplittable over a 3-c.e. e-degree below it.
