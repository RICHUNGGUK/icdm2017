This causes WBANs to suffer from severe channel interference that degrades the communication performance of each WBAN. Since a WBAN handles vital signs that affect human life, the detection or prediction of coexistence condition is needed to guarantee reliable communication for each sensor node of a WBAN. Therefore, this paper presents a learning-based algorithm to efficiently predict the coexistence condition in a multiple-WBAN environment. The proposed algorithm jointly applies PRR and SINR, which are commonly used in wireless communication as a way to measure the quality of wireless connections. Our extensive simulation study using Castalia 3.2 simulator based on the OMNet++platform shows that the proposed algorithm provides more reliable and accurate prediction than existing methods for detecting the coexistence problem in a multiple-WBAN environment.", "paper_title": "A Prediction Algorithm for Coexistence Problem in Multiple-WBAN Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000353520000001"}
