This study aims to establish an analytical framework for polygon-based land use transitions to understand the processes of change regarding types of land uses and their shapes. The polygon event and polygon state help to reveal continuity both spatially and temporally. A polygon event represents a combination of changes in both the type of land use and its shape through a transition process. A polygon state reflects homogeneity during the transition process. Two indices, the stability index and the compactness, were used to enhance the understanding of the transition process. The stability index evaluates the succession of an attribute, while compactness recognizes the geometrical characteristics of a polygon. A case study on Tsukuba City, Japan, was evaluated to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach that is presented here. The proposed analytical framework supports the clarification of land use transition patterns and is effective in explaining the spatiotemporal land use transition process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
