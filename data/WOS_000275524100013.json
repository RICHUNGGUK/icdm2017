Also, using problem-specific knowledge, a very efficient elite guided solution improvement scheme and an appropriate crossover operator have been developed and integrated into the proposed method. Using benchmark problems, the algorithm has been compared with heuristic algorithms having the best performance in the literature. The performance of the developed algorithm is shown to be superior using a simulation study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
