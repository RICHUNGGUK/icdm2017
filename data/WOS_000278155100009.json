The new tests are data-driven smooth tests based on the principal components of certain marked empirical processes that are asymptotically distribution-free, with critical values that are already tabulated. The smooth tests are shown to be optimal in a semiparametric sense discussed in the paper, and they are robust to conditional heteroscedasticity of unknown form. A simulation study shows that the data-driven smooth tests perform very well for a wide range of realistic alternatives and have more power than omnibus and other competing tests. Finally, an application to the S&P 500 stock index and some of its components highlights the merits of our approach. The paper also contains a new weak convergence theorem that is of independent interest. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
