Despite this negative result, the particles' states leave no doubt that a peculiar interaction has occurred: One particle's momentum is changed while the other's remains unaffected, in apparent violation of momentum conservation. Revisiting the foundations of the standard quantum measurement process offers the resolution. Prior to the macroscopic recording of no interaction, a brief critical interval (CI) prevails, during which the particles and the detector's pointer form a subtle entanglement which immediately dissolves. It is this self-cancellation, henceforth \"quantum oblivion (QO),\" that lies at the basis of some well-known intriguing quantum effects. Such is interaction-free measurement (IFM) 1 and its more paradoxical variants like Hardy's Paradox 2 and the quantum liar paradox. 3 Even the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect 4 and weak measurement (WM) 5 turn out to belong to this group. We next study interventions within the CI that produce some other peculiar effects. Finally, we discuss some of the conceptual issues involved. Under a greater time-resolution of the CI, some non-local phenomena turn out to be local. Momentum is conserved due to the quantum uncertainties inflicted by the particle-pointer interaction, which sets the experiment's final boundary condition.", "paper_title": "Quantum oblivion: A master key for many quantum riddles", "paper_id": "WOS:000351136900025"}
