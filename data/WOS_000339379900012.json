In this paper, we focus on the problem of improving the gateway throughput in WMNs while achieving fairness and supporting quality-of-service (QoS) differentiation for end-users. To address this problem, we propose a new distributed dynamic traffic scheduling algorithm that supports different QoS requirements from different users. We also develop a joint weight-aware channel assignment and minimum expected delay routing mechanism. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed work in terms of the achieved throughput and minimized packet loss ratio and delay.", "paper_title": "A QoS aware joint design for wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339379900012"}
