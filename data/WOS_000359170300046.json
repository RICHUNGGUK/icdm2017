Understanding this physical phenomenon and developing some intelligent strategies to effectively determine cutoff frequency have both theoretical and practical significance. This paper proposes a new algorithm for automatically choosing filter cutoff frequency using neuro-fuzzy system. In the proposed method, wavelet theory is used to extract noise information which enhances the accuracy of cutoff frequency calculation and improves filtering performance. A neuro-fuzzy system is developed for modeling cutoff frequency function and adjusting weight values using gradient descent scheme. As a general method, the proposed approach is tested by using typical window functions. Results show that proposed techniques are effective and efficient for automatically determining cutoff frequency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
