To this end, we use three accurate analytical models proposed for deterministic, fully-adaptive, and partially-adaptive routing algorithms in the hypercube. We compare these three different classes of routing algorithms under different working conditions and structural factors. It is widely believed that the level of adaptivity can result in better performance. Our analysis shows that under uniform traffic load, the employed partially-adaptive routing algorithm exhibits a lower performance compared to the considered deterministic routing algorithm.
