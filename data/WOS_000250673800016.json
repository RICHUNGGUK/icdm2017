When combined with additional information, gene expression data in this article, sensitivity and specificity of TFBS search can be improved significantly. Results: By modifying our previous REFINEMENT approach, we developed dPattern that searches for occurrences of TFBSs in the promotor regions of up/down regulated or random genes.", "paper_title": "dPattern: transcription factor binding site (TFBS) discovery in human genome using a discriminative pattern analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000250673800016"}
