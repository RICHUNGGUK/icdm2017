Frequency-hopping sequences are needed in FH code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. In this correspondence, three classes of optimal frequency-hopping sequences are constructed with algebraic methods. The three classes are based on perfect nonlinear functions, power functions, and norm functions, respectively. Both individual optimal frequency-hopping sequences and optimal families of frequency-hopping sequences are presented.", "paper_title": "Algebraic constructions of optimal frequency-hopping sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000247606300022"}
