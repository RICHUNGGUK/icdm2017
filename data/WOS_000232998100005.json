This study suggests two methods for determining the locations of relocated blocks. First, a branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm is suggested. Next, a decision rule is proposed by using an estimator for an expected number of additional relocations for a stack. The performance of the decision rule was compared with that of the B&B algorithm.
