The multi component flow is predicted by a multi-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method (MRT-LBM) which allows independent control of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. The MRT-LBM is verified against results of a passive scalar finite element advection-diffusion model. The geometry of the flow channels is described by a material distribution approach by varying the porosity of a fictitious material. While this material model penalizes fluid velocity it does not prevent diffusion through porous material. We show that for Peclet numbers greater than 1 the diffusion of fluids through porous material does not significantly affect mixing predictions. The material distribution is optimized by a gradient-based optimization scheme using adjoint sensitivities to compute the derivatives of the objective and constraints. For a two-dimensional model problem, we compare optimization results for various formulations of the design problem. The numerical results illustrate the suitability of the proposed method to optimize micro-mixers and show interesting interdependencies between the porosity model and the formulation of the objective function.
