In this paper, we propose a scalable image representation with the ROI functionality in the spatial domain, which allows us to generate a hierarchy of images with arbitrary sizes. The ROI functionality of our scalable representation is a result of a nonuniform grid transformation in the spatial domain, where only the center of ROI and an expansion parameter are to be known. Our grid transformation guarantees no loss of information within the area of ROI.", "paper_title": "Size-Controllable Region-of-Interest in Scalable Image Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000289844400008"}
