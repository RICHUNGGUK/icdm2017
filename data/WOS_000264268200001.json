The chip-level detection can enhance the tolerance of multiple access interference (MAI) because the channel collision does not occur as long as there is at least one weighted position without MAI. Moreover, the spectral-slice scheme can reduce the interference probability because the MAI with the different frequency has no adverse effects on the channel collision rate. As a result, these techniques mitigate channel collisions. We analyze the channel collision rate theoretically, and show that the proposed system can achieve a lower channel collision rate in comparison to both conventional systems with and without the time-encoding method.", "paper_title": "Mitigation Techniques of Channel Collisions in the TTFR-Based Asynchronous Spectral Phase-Encoded Optical CDMA System", "paper_id": "WOS:000264268200001"}
