Renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, micro hydro, tidal and biomass etc. are becoming increasingly important because of the increased interest in protecting the environment. Wind energy is one of the most successfully used renewable energy sources used to produce electrical energy. The proposed approach was implemented on a power system that includes WTGs. Test results demonstrates the viability of the proposed approach for assessing the wind speed credit from the economics view point.", "paper_title": "PROBABILISTIC PRODUCTION COST CREDIT EVALUATION OF WIND TURBINE GENERATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900003"}
