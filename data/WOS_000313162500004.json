The first scheme adjusts the size of the search space for a free wavelength in optical switches using a balancing formula that promotes throughput and hop-count fairness. The formula achieves controllable increase in the size of the search space either when the size of the burst increases or when the hop count of the traveling burst increases. The second scheme proactively discards bursts at the source network access station using a dropping probability matrix that satisfies certain horizontal and vertical constraints. The matrix assigns smaller dropping probabilities to bursts with larger sizes and longer lightpaths. The results of extensive performance tests to evaluate the two schemes and compare them with previous schemes for improving fairness and throughput are presented and discussed. The results show that the two schemes improve the throughput of optical OBS networks and enhance the hop-count fairness.", "paper_title": "Hop-count fairness-aware protocols for improved bandwidth utilization in WDM burst-switched networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313162500004"}
