However, leakage current is rising rapidly as semiconductor technology advances. This makes it difficult to distinguish between faulty and fault-free chips using traditional threshold setting methods. This paper presents a method to estimate leakage current using neighboring chip information on a wafer. Outlier chips are rejected, and a least-squares-fit plane through neighboring chips is used to estimate defect-free I-DDQ. Chips that significantly deviate from the estimate are rejected. The proposed method is evaluated using industrial test data.", "paper_title": "Estimation of fault-free leakage current using wafer-level spatial information", "paper_id": "WOS:000236069600010"}
