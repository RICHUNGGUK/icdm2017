The proposed design results in the highest throughput, the lowest latency, and the lowest energy compared to the complex-domain VLSI implementations to date. The main innovations are a novel complex-domain means of expanding/visiting the intermediate nodes of the search tree on demand, rather than exhaustively, as well as a new distributed sorting scheme to keep track of the best candidates at each search phase. Its support of unbounded infinite lattice decoding distinguishes the present method from previous K-Best strategies and also allows its complexity to scale sublinearly with the modulation order. Since the expansion and sorting cores are data-driven, the architecture is well suited for a pipelined parallel VLSI implementation. The proposed algorithm is used to fabricate a 4x4, 64-QAM complex multiple-input-multiple-output detector in a 0.13-mu m CMOS technology, achieving a clock rate of 417 MHz with the core area of 340 kgates. The chip test results prove that the fabricated design can sustain a throughput of 1 Gb/s with energy efficiency of 110 pJ/bit, the best numbers reported to date.", "paper_title": "Novel MIMO Detection Algorithm for High-Order Constellations in the Complex Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000318172500004"}
