Design/methodology/approach - The present authors invited all involved public-sector agencies to integrate their service processes into a model of one-stop shopping and established collaborative mechanism for providing customized service. Findings - The present study has identified five factors that were critical for success in such an undertaking. These factors included: establishing appropriate regulations for the implementation process; designing a viable collaborative-service system; establishing a closely connected virtual organization; ensuring the participation of senior managers from all agencies; and obtaining the cooperation of the facilitators from various agencies (including appropriate merit and bonus incentives). Practical implications - The real challenge for establishing the collaborative-service web site was managerial - in combining the service processes of a dozen or more agencies to make the model work. Managerial issues that need to be addressed were the design of service processes, the overall organizational structure, the establishment of audit and supervision procedures, and the establishment an operational model for the web site. Originality/value - This web site serves as a successful \"one-stop-shopping\" model that increases L customer satisfaction with the service quality of government agencies. This study provides information for other government agencies that might wish to establish similar collaborative models to enhance service in the public sector.", "paper_title": "A collaborative model for service provision by multiple public-sector agencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000240930800001"}
