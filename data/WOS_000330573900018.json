Although high accuracies have been achieved in detection of apneic episodes and classification into apnea/hypopnea, there has not been a consensus on the best method of selecting the feature parameters. This study presents a classi fi cation scheme for OSA using common features belonging to the time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear calculations of heart rate variability analysis, and then proposes a method of feature selection based on correlation matrices (CMs). The results show that the CMs can be utilized in minimizing the feature sets used for any type of diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Feature selection on single-lead ECG for obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000330573900018"}
