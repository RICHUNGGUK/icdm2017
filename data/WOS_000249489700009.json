To date, most of the segmentation methods reported are either manual, or semi-automated, requiring user interaction at some extent, which increases the analysis time and detection errors. In this work, a fully automated approach for lumen and media-adventitia border detection is presented based on an active contour model, the initialization of which is performed via an analysis mechanism that takes advantage of the inherent morphologic characteristics of IVUS images. The in vivo validation of the proposed model in human coronary arteries revealed that it is a feasible approach, enabling accurate and rapid segmentation of multiple IVUS images.
