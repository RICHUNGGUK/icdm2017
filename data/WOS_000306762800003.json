The correctness, modularity, and flexibility of model transformations is critical to their effective use in practical software development. In this chapter, we describe techniques for model transformation specification and implementation. We focus particularly on the UML-RSDS approach for the automated derivation of transformation implementations from high-level specifications, which uses specification and implementation patterns to guide the choice of implementation strategy for a particular problem. We illustrate this approach using several model transformation case studies of different kinds (re-expression, refinement, quality improvement, and abstraction transformations).", "paper_title": "Model Transformation Specification and Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000306762800003"}
