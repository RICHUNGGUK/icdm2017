Migrating existing legacy applications is a very natural requirement when moving to and adopting a new technology. A service-based development paradigm is one in which components are viewed as services. In this model, services interact and can be providers or consumers of data and behavior. This paper describes an architecture-based approach for the synthesis of services from legacy components and their subsequent integration with service-requesting client applications.
