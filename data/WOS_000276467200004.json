The characteristics of mobile UWSNs, such as low communication bandwidth, large propagation delay, and floating node mobility are significantly different from wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a new efficient routing protocol, called multi-path routing (MPR) protocol, for UWSNs to improve the transmission delay. Multi-path is utilized during the path construction from the source node to the destination node, which is composed of a series of multi-subpaths. Each multi-subpath is a sub-path from a sending node to its two-hop neighboring node, called receiving node, by one more relay nodes, where these relay nodes simultaneously are neighboring nodes of sending and receiving nodes. Due to the different propagation delay of UWSN, the packet arrival time along the different sub-path is different; thus it may avoid the data collision in the receiving node when receiving different packets from different relay nodes. It surely sends the different packet along different sub-path to significantly improve delay time and packet delivery ratio. Finally, simulation results illustrate the performance achievements of the MPR protocol in improving delay time, packet delivery ratio, throughput and reducing overhead ratio.", "paper_title": "A Low Propagation Delay Multi-Path Routing Protocol for Underwater Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276467200004"}
