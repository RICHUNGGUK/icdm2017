The problem is converted into a smooth optimisation that can be solved iteratively with no greater overhead than iteratively re-weighted least-squares. The result is simple, easily programmed and is shown to perform, in terms of both accuracy and parsimony, as well as or better than a number of leading machine learning algorithms on two well-studied and substantial benchmarks.", "paper_title": "A simple iterative algorithm for parsimonious binary kernel Fisher discrimination", "paper_id": "WOS:000273560500002"}
