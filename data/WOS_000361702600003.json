Different from the conventional modified one-step majority-logic decoding algorithms, we design a turbo-like iterative strategy to recover the performance degradation caused by the simply flipping operation. The main computational loads of the presented algorithm include only binary logic and integer operations, resulting in low decoding complexity. Furthermore, by introducing the iterative set, a very small proportion (less than 6%) of variable nodes are involved in the reliability updating process, which can further reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that, combined with the factor correction technique and a well-designed non-uniform quantization scheme, the presented algorithm can achieve a significant performance improvement and a fast decoding speed, even with very small quantization levels (3-4 bits resolution). The presented algorithm provides a candidate for trade-offs between performance and complexity.", "paper_title": "Iterative Reliability-Based Modified Majority-Logic Decoding for Structured Binary LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000361702600003"}
