This paper presents a novel methodology for the segmentation of the LV in three-dimensional (3-D) echocardiographic images based on the probabilistic data association filter (PDAF). The proposed methodology begins by initializing a 3-D deformable model either semiautomatically, with user input, or automatically, and it comprises the following feature hierarchical approach: 1) edge detection in the vicinity of the surface (low-level features); 2) edge grouping to obtain potential LV surface patches (mid-level features); and 3) patch filtering using a shape-PDAF framework (high-level features). This method provides good performance accuracy in 20 echocardiographic volumes, and compares favorably with the state-of-the-art segmentation methodologies proposed in the recent literature.", "paper_title": "Automatic 3-D Segmentation of Endocardial Border of the Left Ventricle From Ultrasound Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000347342300041"}
