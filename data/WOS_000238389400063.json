We report a successful add-on that automatically discovers critical points in elementary extrema problems specified via diagrams. Based in classical one variable calculus, the new module, Optimus, is a step ahead in the cooperation between dynamic geometry and computer algebra systems. It can be used in technology rich environments for mathematics education, adding new calculus abilities to dynamic geometry software.", "paper_title": "Automated discovery in elementary extrema problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400063"}
