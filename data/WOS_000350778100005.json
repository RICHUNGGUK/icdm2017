This paper presents how to quantify and mitigate the bullwhip effect by introducing model predictive control (MPC) strategy into the ordering policy for a benchmark supply chain system. Instead of quantifying the bullwhip effect with commonly used statistical measure, we derive equivalently the expression of bullwhip metric via control-theoretic approach by applying discrete Fourier transform and (inverse) z-transform when the demand signal is stationary stochastic. A four-echelon supply chain is formulated and its dynamical features are analyzed to give the discrete model. An extended prediction self-adaptive control (EPSAC) approach to the multi-step predictor is implemented in the development of MPC formulation. The closed-form solution to MPC problem is derived by minimizing a specified objective function. The transfer function for MPC ordering policy is then obtained graphically from an equivalent representation of this closed-form solution. A numerical simulation shows that MPC ordering policy outperforms the traditional ordering policies on reducing bullwhip effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
