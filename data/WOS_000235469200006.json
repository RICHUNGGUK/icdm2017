Remiddi, J.A.M. Vermaseren, Int. J. Modem Phys. A 15 (2000) 725, hep-ph/9905237] for Mathematica. It contains an implementation of the product algebra, the derivative properties, series expansion and numerical evaluation. The analytic continuation has been treated carefully, allowing the user to keep the control over the definition of the sign of the imaginary parts. Many options enables the user to adapt the behavior of the package to his specific problem.", "paper_title": "HPL, a Mathematica implementation of the harmonic polylogarithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000235469200006"}
