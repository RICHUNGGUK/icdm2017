A necessary and sufficient condition is derived under which a watermark is first embedded, and can later be recovered with high probability at the output of a public watermark decoder after the watermarked signal is disturbed by a fixed memoryless attack channel. Interestingly, the condition also implies that the Shannon separation theorem does not hold in this scenario.", "paper_title": "On information embedding when watermarks and covertexts are correlated", "paper_id": "WOS:000257111500043"}
