The process is modeled as a network of process systems with multiple recycle streams and energy integration. One of the key problems that we address in the paper is how to determine dissipativity properties of the process network from the dissipativity properties of the individual process systems and the topology of the network. The results in the paper extend the dissipativity analysis based on thermodynamics for individual processes to dissipativity-based conditions (storage functions and supply rates) suitable for process network analysis. The new storage and supply functions are based on balance equations represented in terms of temperatures and compositions rather than internal energy and chemical potentials. This makes the theory easier to apply to typical chemical process model systems. A simple example is provided to illustrate the application of the theory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
