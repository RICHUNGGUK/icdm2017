The enhancements can be applied to any link state or distance vector routing protocols An evaluation considering node density node mobility and link error show that TPC and RA aware routing algorithms improve the aver age latency and the end to-end throughput while consuming less energy than traditional protocols (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Transmission power and data rate aware routing on wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284567000004"}
