A high-speed camera is used to identify the phases of the flapping motion of the wings. The results emphasize the importance of the coupling between the flexible wings and the flow in future CFD efforts. The results also show that a large-scale vortex ring is shed into the near-wake region during the fling motion of the side wings of the current MAV. The three-dimensional features of this vortex ring are visualized and characterized from the velocity and vorticity fields measured in the four particle image velocimetry planes.", "paper_title": "Visualization and characterization of near-wake flow fields of a flapping-wing micro air vehicle using PIV", "paper_id": "WOS:000313711900011"}
