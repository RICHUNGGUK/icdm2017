The challenge of transferring these data to a sink, because of energy constraints, requires suitable techniques such as data compression. Transform-based compression, e.g. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), are very popular in this field. These methods behave well enough if there is a correlation in data. However, especially for environmental measurements, data may not be correlated. In this work, we propose two approaches based on F-transform, a recent fuzzy approximation technique. We evaluate our approaches with Discrete Wavelet Transform on publicly available real-world data sets. The comparative study shows the capabilities of our approaches, which allow a higher data compression rate with a lower distortion, even if data are not correlated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
