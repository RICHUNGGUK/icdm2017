We have proposed PDAODMRP (Passive Data Acknowledgement ODMRP) to adapt the limited bandwidth and frequently changing topology of ad hoc network. PDAODMRP defines the adjacent un-forwarding nodes of forwarding nodes as pool nodes to reduces its local route maintenance scope, and its local route maintenance scope is at least one-hop smaller than that of PatchODMRP. However, PDAODMRP does not make full use of its multiple paths by distributing its data load to these paths. Therefore, in this paper, we propose MPDAODMRP (Multipath PDAODMRP) to extend PDAODMRP. MPDAODMRP distributes data overhead to multipath based on diversity coding. The simulation results show that the data overhead and the data delivery delay of MPDAODMRP are much lower than that of PDAODMRP. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
