In this paper, we propose the first fuzzy identity-based signcryption scheme in lattice-based cryptography. Firstly, we give a fuzzy identity-based signcryption scheme that is indistinguishable against chosen plaintext attack under selective identity model. Then we apply Fujisaki-Okamoto method to obtain a fuzzy identity-based signcryption scheme that is indistinguishable against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack under selective identity model. Thirdly, we prove our scheme is existentially unforgeable against chosen message attack under selective identity model. As far as we know, our scheme is the first fuzzy identity-based signcryption scheme that is secure even in the quantum environment.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Identity-Based Signcryption Scheme from Lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900032"}
