However, they are limited in the quality of the video. People have become accustomed to watching videos being played on bigger displays, such as televisions. IPTV is a system that provides digital television service by using Internet Protocol over a network infrastructure. Although the two kinds of video services are applied in different contexts, the processes of service transfer are less convenient when the user changes their environments. In this study, a \"VCIS-TV\" framework based On distributed processing is proposed, in which a mobile video service can be integrated into an IPTV service via context transfer and handheld devices can continue to serve people with a cooperative remote control service. This involves cooperation between different devices and services since these devices and services aid people in different contexts. In the VCIS-TV framework, people can easily make good use of handheld devices in a mobile video service, cooperative video services, and remote control services in a smart home. This is a seamless and integrated digital television service for a more convenient life.", "paper_title": "A VARIABLE CONTROL INTEGRATED SERVICE FRAMEWORK FOR MOBILE TV AND IPTV", "paper_id": "WOS:000271036900016"}
