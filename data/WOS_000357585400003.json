The software solves the two-dimensional shallow water equations using a first-order accurate Godunov-type shock-capturing scheme incorporated with the Harten, Lax and van Leer approximate Riemann solver with the contact wave restored (HLLC) for flux evaluation. The benefits of modern graphics processing units are explored to accelerate large-scale high-resolution simulations. In order to test its performance, the tool is applied to predict flood inundation due to rainfall and a point source surface flow in Glasgow, Scotland, and a hypothetical inundation event at different spatial resolutions in Thamesmead, England, caused by embankment failure. Numerical experiments demonstrate potential benefits for high-resolution modelling of urban flood inundation, and a much-improved level of performance without compromising result quality.", "paper_title": "A high-performance integrated hydrodynamic modelling system for urban flood simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000357585400003"}
