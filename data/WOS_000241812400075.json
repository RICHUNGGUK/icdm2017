The framework we propose builds on top of the ARIADNE service oriented architecture for learning object repositories, abstracting from the technicalities of low level metadata and resource management. As a case study, the framework has been applied in a university learning management system (SIDWeb). The intent is to exploit contextual information from the learning management system in digital repositories.", "paper_title": "A context-aware service oriented framework for finding, recommending and inserting learning objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400075"}
