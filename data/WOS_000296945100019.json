In this paper a simple competing risks distribution is proposed as a possible alternative to the Exponential or weibull distributions usually considered in lifetime data analysis. We consider the case when the competing risks have a Lindley distribution. Also, we assume that the competing events are uncorrelated and that each subject can experience only one type of event at any particular time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
