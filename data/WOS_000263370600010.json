The earlier preconditioners for the Helmholtz equation are generalized for elastic materials and three-dimensional domains. An algebraic multigrid method is used in approximating the inverse of damped operators. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the behavior of the method in complicated two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
