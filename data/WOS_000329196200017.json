We construct a routing tree and propose two scheduling algorithms that can generate collision-free link schedules for data aggregation. We prove that the delay of each algorithm is O(R + Delta) time slots, where R and Delta are respectively the graph radius and the maximum node degree in a reduced communication graph of the original network; the proposed algorithms are asymptotically optimum on delay in random wireless sensor networks. We evaluate the performances of the proposed algorithms and the simulation results corroborate our theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Efficient Aggregation Scheduling in Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks with SINR Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000329196200017"}
