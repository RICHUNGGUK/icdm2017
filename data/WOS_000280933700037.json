This implementation allows one to change the shape of the characteristic function easily and this makes it easier to place the circuit in a given point of the alpha-beta diagram. A mathematical model is proposed for the simulation of the new characteristic function, and several theoretical and experimental tests are presented using commercial chip circuits.
