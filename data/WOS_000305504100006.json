Among the best of such SPDEs the Burgers equation shows a prototypical model for describing the interaction between the reaction mechanism, convection effect, and diffusion transport. This paper discusses spectral collocation method to reduce stochastic Burgers equation to a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs). The resulting SODEs system is then solved by an explicit 3-stage stochastic Runge-Kutta method of strong order one. The convergence rate of Fourier collocation method for Burgers equation is also obtained. Some numerical experiments are included to show the performance of the method. (C) 2012 IMACS.
