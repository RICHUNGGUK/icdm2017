Then, based on this representation, complex Eigenfaces technique is developed for facial feature extraction, Finally, we test our idea using the AR face database. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed color image based complex Eigenfaces method is more robust to illumination variations than the traditional grayscale image based Eigenfaces.", "paper_title": "Recognize color face images using complex Eigenfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300009"}
