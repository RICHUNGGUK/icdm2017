A two-parameter family of interpolating surfaces is generated by repeated bicubic interpolation of the given data points, and then a solution to the envelope condition and the envelope of the family are constructed. The continuity conditions of two adjacent patches along the common boundary are derived by analyzing the geometric properties of the envelope patch. In order to facilitate surface modeling, an envelope template is constructed, which has many desirable advantages including simple structure, good local features and so on. G(2) or C(2) composite surfaces can be obtained utilizing the envelope template sweeping over the data points. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
