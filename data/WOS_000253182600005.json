It is shown that these analytical structures are not suitable for control purpose. In this context, it is extremely important to note that the analytical structures reported by Carvajal et al. are also not valid for control.", "paper_title": "Analytical structures for fuzzy PID controllers?", "paper_id": "WOS:000253182600005"}
