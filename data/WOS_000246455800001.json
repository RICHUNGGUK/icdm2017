The CDS of a graph representing a network has a significant impact on the efficient design of routing protocols in wireless networks. This problem has been studied extensively in Unit Disk Graphs (UDG), in which all nodes have the same transmission ranges. However, in practice, the transmission ranges of all nodes are not necessarily equal. In this paper, we model a network as a disk graph and introduce the CDS problem in disk graphs. We present two efficient approximation algorithms to obtain a minimum CDS. The performance ratio of these algorithms is constant if the ratio of the maximum transmission range over the minimum transmission range in the network is bounded. These algorithms can be implemented as distributed algorithms. Furthermore, we show a size relationship between a maximal independent set and a CDS as well as a bound of the maximum number of independent neighbors of a node in disk graphs. The theoretical analysis and simulation results are also presented to verify our approaches.", "paper_title": "Connected dominating sets in wireless networks with different transmission ranges", "paper_id": "WOS:000246455800001"}
