Using only one partially entangled pair, we first propose two novel strategies for probabilistically teleporting any partially entangled state of a bipartite system. The feature of the present protocol is to weaken the requirement for the quantum channel, and also to cut down the number of entangled particles initially shared by the sender and receiver. On the other hand, we explicitly construct the generalized measurement described by the positive operator-valued measure (POVM). Two kinds of efficient quantum circuits for implementing the teleportation are offered. In addition, we generalize the two-particle probabilistic teleportation to the system of many particles.", "paper_title": "Quantum circuits for probabilistic entanglement teleportation via a partially entangled pair", "paper_id": "WOS:000251351100006"}
