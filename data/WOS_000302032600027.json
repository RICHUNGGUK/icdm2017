A task-oriented procedure is developed for determining the relative importance of the evaluation and selection criteria with respect to a specific shipping task. A fuzzy multicriteria analysis algorithm is developed for determining the overall performance of each ship across all the selection criteria and their associated sub-criteria. An intelligent decision support system capable of integrating the developments above is proposed for facilitating the ship evaluation and selection process. An example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent decision support system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
