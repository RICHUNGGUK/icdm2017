It is assumed that the arrival times of change orders follow a fuzzy renewal process. The contingency based on the confidence level offered by the decision-maker is estimated by fuzzy simulation. Furthermore, the effect of schedule delays which increase further the project cost and schedule is considered explicitly. Finally, three numerical examples are presented to illustrate the application of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Estimating the contingency of R&D project in a fuzzy environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300102"}
