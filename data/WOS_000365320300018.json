The transitions of NNs modes and desired mode-dependent filters are considered to be asynchronous, and a nonhomogeneous mode transition matrix of filters is used to model the asynchronous jumps to different degrees that are also mode-dependent. The unknown time-varying delays are also supposed to be mode-dependent with lower and upper bounds known a priori. The unideal measurements model includes the phenomena of randomly occurring quantization and missing measurements in a unified form. The desired resilient filters are designed such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity performance index. A monotonicity is disclosed in filtering performance index as the degree of asynchronous jumps changes. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the potential and validity of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Resilient Asynchronous H-infinity Filtering for Markov Jump Neural Networks With Unideal Measurements and Multiplicative Noises", "paper_id": "WOS:000365320300018"}
