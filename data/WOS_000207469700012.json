The derived dynamic equation uses only link angles as generalized coordinates, which is suitable for the controller design in joint space. Since joint coupling, model uncertainties in robot dynamics are treated as lumped disturbances, a disturbance observer is developed at each joint of degree-of-freedom space manipulator to decouple and simplify the controller design. Simulation results of a six-link space manipulator show that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance, especially when large external disturbances are present.", "paper_title": "Disturbance Observer-Based Robust Control of Free-Floating Space Manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000207469700012"}
