In this paper we study the exponential time differencing fourth-order Runge-Kutta (ETDRK4) method: this scheme was derived by Cox and Matthews in [S.M. Cox, RC. Matthews, Exponential time differencing for stiff systems, J. Comp. Phys. 176 (2002) 430-455] and was modified by Kassam and Trefethen in [A. Kassam, L.N. Trefethen, Fourth-order time stepping for stiff PDEs, SIAM J. Sci. Comp. 26 (2005) 1214-1233]. We compute its amplification factor and plot its stability region, which gives us an explanation of its good behavior for dissipative and dispersive problems. We apply this method to the Schrodinger equation, obtaining excellent results for the cubic equation and the critical exponent case and, later, as an experimental approach to describe the various possible asymptotic behaviors with two space variables.
