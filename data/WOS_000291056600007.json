The new interpolation schemes provide generally applicable interpolation schemes between an arbitrary number of pre-defined materials with given (anisotropic) properties. The method relies on a large number of sparse linear constraints to enforce the selection of at most one material in each design subdomain. Topology and multi-material optimization is formulated within a unified parametrization.", "paper_title": "Material interpolation schemes for unified topology and multi-material optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000291056600007"}
