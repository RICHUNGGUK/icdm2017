A highly linear active mixer with low flicker noise and low noise active load is proposed. An efficient and low cost on-chip DC offset voltage canceling scheme is adopted with a high-input-impedance four-input OPAMP to buffer the output of the DC offset canceller (DCOC) block. The receiver has a measured input 1 dB compression point of -2 dBm and a sensitivity of -72 dBm in the presence of the large leakage signal from the transmitter. Only occupying a silicon area of 2.5 mm(2) and consuming 21 mA from a 1.8 V supply, the receiver makes the mobile UHF RFID reader to communicate with a transponder in a distance of 1 m conveniently.", "paper_title": "A novel compact low-power direct conversion receiver for mobile UHF RFID reader", "paper_id": "WOS:000308814500006"}
