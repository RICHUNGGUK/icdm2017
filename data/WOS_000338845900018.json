The computation and transmission capability of each node are limited. In this paper, a self-updating one-time password mutual authentication protocol for Ad hoc network is proposed. The most significant feature is that a hash chain can update by itself smoothly and securely through capturing the secure bit of the tip. The updating process does not need any additional protocol or re-initialization process and can be continued indefinitely to give rise to an infinite length hash chain, that is, the times of authentication is unlimited without reconstructing a new hash chain. Besides, two random variable are added into the messages interacted during the mutual authentication, enabling the protocol to resist man-in-the-middle attack. Also, the user's identity information is introduced into the seed of hash chain, so the scheme achieves anonymity and traceability at the same time.", "paper_title": "Self-Updating One-Time Password Mutual Authentication Protocol for Ad Hoc Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000338845900018"}
