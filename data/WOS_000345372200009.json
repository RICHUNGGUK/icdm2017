However, the nature of the relationship between the degree of mechanical stability provided by a flexible fixation and the optimal healing outcomes has not been fully understood. In this study, we have developed a validated quantitative model to predict how cells in fracture callus might respond to change in their mechanical microenvironment due to different configurations of locking compression plate (LCP) in clinical practice, particularly in the early stage of healing. The model predicts that increasing flexibility of the LCP by changing the bone-plate distance (BPD) or the plate working length (WL) could enhance interfragmentary strain in the presence of a relatively large gap size (>3mm). Furthermore, conventional LCP normally results in asymmetric tissue development during early stage of callus formation, and the increase of BPD or WL is insufficient to alleviate this problem.", "paper_title": "Computational simulation of the early stage of bone healing under different configurations of locking compression plates", "paper_id": "WOS:000345372200009"}
