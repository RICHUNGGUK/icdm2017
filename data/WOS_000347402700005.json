We designed a hybrid control architecture which integrates task, path, motion planning/replanning, and execution monitoring. The high-level system relies on a continuous monitoring and planning cycle to suitably react to events, user interventions, and failures, communicating with the low level control layers. The system has been assessed on real-world and simulated scenarios representing an industrial environment.", "paper_title": "Aerial service vehicles for industrial inspection: task decomposition and plan execution", "paper_id": "WOS:000347402700005"}
