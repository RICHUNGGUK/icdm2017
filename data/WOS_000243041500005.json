This paper addresses a novel approach of two-dimensional unequal error protection (2-D UEP) for the scalable video with a combined temporal and quality (SNR) scalability over packet-erasure channel. The bit-stream is divided into scalable subbitstreams based on the structure of MCTF. Each subbitstream is further divided into several quality layers. Unequal quantities of bits are allocated to protect different layers to obtain acceptable quality video with smooth degradation under different transmission error conditions. Experimental results are presented to show the advantage of the proposed 2-D UEP scheme over the traditional one-dimensional unequal error protection (1-D UEP) scheme. Comparing the proposed method with the 1-D UEP scheme on SNR layers, our method gives up to 0.81-dB improvement for some video sequences.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional channel coding scheme for MCTF-based scalable video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000243041500005"}
