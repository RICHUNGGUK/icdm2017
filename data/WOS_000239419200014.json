In our method, parametric, implicit and explicit functions can be used concurrently for defining geometry, colour, texture, and other properties of shapes. Geometric shapes and their properties are defined by functions in their respective domains and then merged into function-defined objects. The proposed framework allows for its extending with any function-based model. To illustrate our method and to prove its feasibility, we implemented it for web visualisation as the Function-based Extension of Virtual Reality Modelling Language. In this implementation, parametric implicit and explicit analytical formulae are used for defining geometry and appearance of three-dimensional (3D) shapes. The function-based extension of VRML is used for collaborative shape modelling as well as for building shared virtual worlds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
