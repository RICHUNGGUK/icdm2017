As link rates and traffic volumes of Internet are constantly growing, string matching using Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) will be the performance bottleneck of DPI. The recently proposed bit-split string matching algorithm suffers from the unnecessary state transitions problem. The root cause lies in the fact that the bit-split algorithm makes pattern matching in a \"not seeing the forest for trees\" approach, where each tiny DFA only processes a b-bit substring of each input character, but cannot check whether the entire character belongs to the alphabet of original DFA. This paper presents a byte- filtered string matching algorithm, where Bloom filters are used to preprocess each character of every incoming packet to check whether the character belongs to the original alphabet, before performing bit- split string matching. If not, each tiny DFA either makes a transition to its initial state or stops any state transition. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the bit- split algorithm, our byte-filtered algorithm enormously reduces the string matching time as well as the number of state transitions of tiny DFAs on both synthetic and real signature rule sets.
