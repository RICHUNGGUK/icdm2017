We also present a method to build overlap indices using overlap functions, and we carry on a theoretical study about the continuity, the invariance, and some general properties of such indices. We present a generalization of the inference algorithm for interpolative fuzzy systems using overlap indices. We also propose an algorithm for choosing, among a set of overlap indices, the best one for a considered problem.", "paper_title": "Overlap Indices: Construction of and Application to Interpolative Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400039"}
