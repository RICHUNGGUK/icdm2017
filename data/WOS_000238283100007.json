To this aim, we adopt the tools of the JPEG2000 Wireless (JPWL) standard, by introducing a method for Unequal Error Protection (UEP) and a virtual interleaving technique of the stream. All these techniques are introduced while keeping a complete backward-compatibility with the existing standard.", "paper_title": "Backward-compatible interleaving technique for robust JPEG2000 wireless transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000238283100007"}
