The relativistic Oppenheimer Volkoff (OV) equations of hydrostatic equilibrium are solved using (a) the well-known variable step method, (b) a method based on a modified form of the OV equations, where the thermodynamic enthalpy function is the independent variable, and (c) a new straightforward method, based on the ODEPACK Fortran package for solving systems of differential equations. We present results concerning several equations of state and conclusions concerning the applicability of each method.", "paper_title": "Numerical methods for solving the relativistic Oppenheimer Volkoff equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000253297900007"}
