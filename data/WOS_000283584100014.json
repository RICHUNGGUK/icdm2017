We propose a network architecture based on the cyclic symmetric block design class of wakeup schemes. Using a target tracking application as an example, specific requirements of the application translates to design parameters in our proposed solution. Our proposal demonstrates good delay performances, high target tracking accuracies and low target identification errors, without the need for costly double-radio channels while increasing network lifetimes by a factor of four to eight over traditional methods.", "paper_title": "Query-enabled sensor networks using the cyclic symmetric wakeup design", "paper_id": "WOS:000283584100014"}
