This paper presents a biologically inspired proxy-based multimedia content adaptation system, which is used to repurpose multimedia content dynamically for the transmission over heterogeneous networks and end devices. We use a series of repurposing proxies' services in a chain fashion between the sender and multiple end devices. In order to find the appropriate chain of repurposing services that satisfy the Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements, the proposed service selection algorithm uses the ant colony metaphor. During the communication session, the algorithm uses biological foraging behavior inspired from ant agents to find optimal service paths between the media sender and the destination. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides significant performance gain over traditional, state of the art selection algorithms and saves the average delay.", "paper_title": "A biologically inspired multimedia content repurposing system in heterogeneous environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000258706100002"}
