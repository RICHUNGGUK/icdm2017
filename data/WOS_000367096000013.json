He proved the theorem by deriving the exponent function of error probability of correct decoding that is positive if and only if R > C. Subsequently, in 1979, Dueck and Korner determined the optimal exponent of correct decoding. Arimoto's bound has been said to be equal to the bound of Dueck and Korner. However its rigorous proof has not been presented so far. In this paper we give a rigorous proof of the equivalence of Arimoto's bound to that of Dueck and Korner.", "paper_title": "On Two Strong Converse Theorems for Discrete Memoryless Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000013"}
