In this paper, the two-prime sequence is employed to construct several classes of cyclic codes over GF(q). Lower bounds on the minimum weight of these cyclic codes are developed. Some of the codes obtained are optimal or almost optimal. The p-ranks of the twin-prime difference sets and a class of almost difference sets are computed.", "paper_title": "Cyclic Codes From the Two-Prime Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000304245100039"}
