This system used a simple method to install cameras, which can capture the video images from the left to the right perspectives synchronously, for the sake of reducing the influence from vehicles height or width by fusing the image plane information of multicameras. Firstly, based on the synchronous and adaptive camera calibration method, images from different cameras are projected onto a same world coordinate, which is a top view picture of the same detecting region. Secondly, in order to improve the environment adaptability, an advanced method of time-spatial image is proposed to extract traffic information. At the same time, through network communication, traffic information picked up by each camera is transformed to the SDF timely. Finally, combined with probability fusion map, SDF fuses information grabbed by all cameras to improve the accuracy of traffic parameters extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be implemented quickly and accurately either in crowed state or in fluent state.", "paper_title": "A Traffic Parameters Extraction Method Using Time-Spatial Image Based on Multicameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000315872000001"}
