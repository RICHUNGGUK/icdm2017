A new category of data-quality solutions that fill this need using intelligent matching and retrieval algorithms is discussed. Solutions are focused on customer and sales data and include real-time inexact search, batch processing, and data migration. Users are empowered to maintain higher quality data resulting in more efficient sales and marketing operations. Sales managers spend more time with customers and less time managing data.", "paper_title": "Exceptional Data Quality Using Intelligent Matching and Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000276177700005"}
