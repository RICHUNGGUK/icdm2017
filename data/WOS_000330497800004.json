In order to diminish the computational complexity, incremental update algorithm is developed, especially for analyzing relationships between text documents. However, it is at the cost of a reduction in precision. In this paper, we study the effect of incremental update on latent semantic analysis; and, by experiments, to investigate the trend downward of computing precision and then try to find the balance point between re-computation and incremental update. The results indicate that when increased documents are less than original documents, incremental update method has an approximate precision to re-computing method, and then its recall ratio will obviously decline. It could be helpful for deciding when the matrix factorization must be recomputed.", "paper_title": "An Experimental Study of Incremental SVD on Latent Semantic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000330497800004"}
