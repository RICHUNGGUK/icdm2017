Unlike the large proprietary systems of the 1980s, today's \"micro-applications\" allow firms to create and reconfigure digital capabilities to appropriate short-term competitive advantage. In the quest to provide value to customers through digitization, such applications can be efficiently deployed. However, we propose that in the long-term not all digitization is desirable. Indiscriminate digital initiatives through the use of micro-applications by a firm could \"reveal its hand\" to competitors and erode competitiveness. We propose that a firm's DBS must balance its system-software, process, and information-visibility with the ability to appropriate value from such systems. Through a visibility-value framework, and examples drawn from practice, this article illustrates the tradeoffs involved in making these choices as the firm traverses a dynamic business environment. In doing so, it raises sensitivity to an important caveat in digital environments epitomized by hyper-competition and transparency.", "paper_title": "REVEALING YOUR HAND: CAVEATS IN IMPLEMENTING DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000329754600021"}
