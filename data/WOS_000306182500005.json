In this paper, we generalize the CVT concept to graphs via a variational characterization. Given a graph and a 3D polygonal surface, our method optimizes the placement of the vertices of the graph in such a way that the graph segments best approximate the shape of the surface. We formulate the computation of CVT for graphs as a continuous variational problem, and present a simple, approximate method for solving this problem. Our method is robust in the sense that it is independent of degeneracies in the input mesh, such as skinny triangles, T-junctions, small gaps or multiple connected components. We present some applications, to skeleton fitting and to shape segmentation.", "paper_title": "Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation of Line Segments and Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000306182500005"}
