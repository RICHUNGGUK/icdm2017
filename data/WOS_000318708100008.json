Firstly, the FMO checkerboard pattern is used at the encoder, so as to prevent MBs of a large area getting lost. Then at the decoder, Greedy Spread Motion Region Extraction (GSMRE) method is used to distinguish low-motion region from high-motion region in each frame based on different motion characteristic, and apply different strategies to recover regions with different characteristics respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reconstructs the lost frame with both a better visual quality and a higher PSNR, comparing to error concealment methods including Joint Model, boundary matching, inpainting, and block motion vector extrapolation as well. For example, the PSNR gain of our approach over boundary matching algorithm reached about 0.6 dB, and 1.4 dB when the packet loss rate is 3 and 7%, respectively, which demonstrates that our method has an good application within a wide scope of packet loss rate.", "paper_title": "Motion characteristic differentiated error concealment", "paper_id": "WOS:000318708100008"}
