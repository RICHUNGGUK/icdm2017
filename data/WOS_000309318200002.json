The main purpose is to design a network that is not only able to accommodate the communication need of all users in a certain area, but also with lower cost than previous design methods of the network. Considering the propagation and attenuation of radio signals, the problem can be transformed to search for best locations of centers of circles in order to reach maximum coverage percent in the whole area. Applying the Simulated Annealing Algorithm and Monte-Carlo Algorithm, numerical examples are given to show the potential of the proposed techniques. Compared with previous method, our proposed method shows its effectiveness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
