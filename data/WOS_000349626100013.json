The inherent variability of the wireless channel as well as the Variable Bit Rate (VBR) of the compressed video streams make QoE management a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate scheduling algorithms to transmit multiple video streams from a base station to mobile clients. We present an epoch-by-epoch framework to fairly allocate wireless transmission slots to streaming videos. In each epoch, our scheme reduces the vulnerability to stalling by allocating slots to videos in a way that maximizes the minimum \"playout lead\" across all videos. We show that the problem of allocating slots fairly is NP-complete even for a constant number of videos. We then present a fast lead-aware greedy scheduling algorithm. Our greedy algorithm is optimal when the channel quality of a user remains unchanged within an epoch. Our experimental results, based on public MPEG-4 video traces and wireless channel traces that we collected from a WiMAX test-bed, show that the lead-aware greedy approach results in a fair distribution of stalls across the clients when compared to other algorithms, while still maintaining similar or fewer average number of stalls per client.", "paper_title": "On Managing Quality of Experience of Multiple Video Streams in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349626100013"}
