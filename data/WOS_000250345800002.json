The four steps of this approach are detailed, highlighted with three examples: a model-oriented problematic, an application in a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) context, and a methodological approach in the car-manufacturing context. Finally, a comparison of these three studies is discussed.", "paper_title": "Case studies in model integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000250345800002"}
