The results show that MINMAX has similar results in terms of average distortion with MINAVE by using SSIM, which illustrates the consistency between these two criteria in independent perceptual video coding. Further more, MINMAX results in lower quality fluctuation, which shows its advantage for perceptual video coding.", "paper_title": "A Study on Consistency between MINAVE and MINMAX in SSIM Based Independent Perceptual Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474300021"}
