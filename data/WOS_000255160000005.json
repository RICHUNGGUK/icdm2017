It allows for universally quantified variables that can model uncertain actions and events, such as the unknown weather for a future party, or an opponent's next move in a game. Although interest in QCSPs is increasing in recent years, the development of techniques for handling QCSPs is still at an early stage. For example, although it is well known that local consistencies are of primary importance in CSPs, only arc consistency has been extended to quantified problems. In this paper we contribute towards the development of solution methods for QCSPs in two ways. First, by extending directional arc and path consistency, two popular local consistencies in constraint satisfaction, to the quantified case and proposing an algorithm that achieves these consistencies. Second, by showing how value ordering heuristics can be utilized to speed up computation in QCSPs. We study the impact of preprocessing QCSPs with value reordering and directional quantified arc and path consistency by running experiments on randomly generated problems. Results show that our preprocessing methods can significantly speed up the QCSP solving process, especially on hard instances from the phase transition region.", "paper_title": "Preprocessing quantified constraint satisfaction problems with value reordering and directional arc and path consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000255160000005"}
