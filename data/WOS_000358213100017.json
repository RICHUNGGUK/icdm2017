By using a radial basis function NN (RBFNN), a bound of unknown nonlinear functions is approximated so that no information about the upper bound of mismatched uncertainties is required. Then, an observer-based adaptive controller based on RBFNN is designed to stabilize uncertain nonlinear systems with immeasurable states. The state-feedback and observer-based controllers are based on Lyapunov and strictly positive real-Lyapunov stability theory, respectively, and it is shown that the asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system to zero is achieved while maintaining bounded states at the same time. The presented methods are more general than the previous approaches, handling systems with no restriction on the dimension of the system and the number of inputs. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods in the stabilization of mismatched nonlinear systems.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neural Stabilizing Controller for a Class of Mismatched Uncertain Nonlinear Systems by State and Output Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100017"}
