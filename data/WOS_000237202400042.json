Most algorithms can be divided into a hard decision algorithm and a soft decision algorithm. The Weighted Bit Flipping (WBF) algorithm that is between a hard decision and a soft decision algorithms has been proposed. The Bootstrapped WBF and Modified WBF algorithms have been proposed to improve the error rate performance and decoding complexity of the WBF algorithm. In this letter, we apply the Bootstrap step to the Modified WBF algorithm. We show that the Bootstrapped modified WBF algorithm outperforms the WBF, Bootstrapped WBF, and Modified WBF algorithms. Moreover, we show that the Bootstrapped modified WBF algorithm has the lowest decoding complexity.", "paper_title": "Bootstrapped modified weighted bit flipping decoding of low density parity check codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000237202400042"}
