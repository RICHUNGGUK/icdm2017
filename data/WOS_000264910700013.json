In this framework, we consider the problem of energy efficient Communication among nodes of a wireless sensor network and propose an application-driven approach that minimizes radio activity intervals and prolongs network lifetime. On the basis of possible Communication delays we estimate packet arrival intervals at any intermediate hop of a fixed-rate data path. We study a generic strategy of radio activity minimization wherein each mode maintains the radio switched on just in the expected packet arrival intervals and guarantees low Communication latency. We define a probabilistic Model that allows the evaluation of the packet loss probability that results front the reduced radio activity. The Model Call be used to optimally choose the radio activity intervals that achieve a certain probability of successful packet delivery for a specific radio activity strategy,v. Relying oil the probabilistic model we also define I cost model that estimates the energy consumption of the proposed strategies, under specific settings. We propose three specific strategies and numerically evaluate the associated Costs. We finally Validate our work with a simulation made with TOSSIM the Berkeley motes' simulator). The simulation results confirm the Validity Of the approach and the accuracy of the analytic models.
