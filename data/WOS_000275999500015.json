Knuth's algorithm is well suited for use with large codewords. The redundancy of Knuth's balanced codes is a factor of two larger than that of a code comprising the full set of balanced codewords. In this paper, we will present results of our attempts to improve the performance of Knuth's balanced codes.", "paper_title": "Knuth's Balanced Codes Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000275999500015"}
