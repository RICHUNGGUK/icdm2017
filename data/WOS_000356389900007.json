However, the emergence of Opportunistic Networking (ON) has opened up crowdsourcing to the spatial domain. In this article, we bring the ON model for potential crowdsourcing in the smart city environment. We introduce cognitive features of the ON that allow users' mobile devices to become aware of the surrounding physical environment. Specifically, we exploit cognitive psychology studies on dynamic memory structures and cognitive heuristics-mental models that describe how the human brain handles decision making among complex and real-time stimuli. Combined with ON, these cognitive features allow devices to act as proxies in their users' cyberworlds and exchange knowledge to deliver awareness of places in an urban environment. This is done through tags associated with locations. They represent features that are perceived by humans about a place. We consider the extent to which this knowledge becomes available to participants using interactions with locations and other nodes. This is assessed taking into account a wide range of cognitive parameters. Outcomes are important because this functionality could support a new type of recommendation system that is independent of the traditional forms of networking.", "paper_title": "Crowdsourcing through Cognitive Opportunistic Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356389900007"}
