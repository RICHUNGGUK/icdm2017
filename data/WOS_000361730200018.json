Inverse uncertainty distribution provides an easy way to calculate the functions of uncertain variables as well as their expected values. This paper mainly presents a formula to calculate the variance of an uncertain variable via the inverse uncertainty distribution. Besides, some inequalities about the variance of uncertain variables are also derived.", "paper_title": "A formula to calculate the variance of uncertain variable", "paper_id": "WOS:000361730200018"}
