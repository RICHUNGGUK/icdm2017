As we cannot act directly on the search engines methodology, we propose to rather act on the documents retrieved by classifying and ranking them properly. A classifier combination approach is considered. These classifiers are chosen very complementary in order to treat all the query aspects and to present to the user at the end a readable and comprehensible result. The application performed corresponds to the law articles stemmed from the European Union data base. The law texts are always entangled with cross-references and accompanied by some updating files (for application dates, for new terms and formulations). Our approach found here a real application offering to the specialist (jurist, lawyer, etc.) a synthetic vision of the law related to the topic requested.", "paper_title": "Toward file consolidation by document categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773400039"}
