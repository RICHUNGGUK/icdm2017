It is among the most well-known NP-complete and W[1]-complete problems. Moreover, its average-case complexity analysis has created a long thread of research already since the 1970s. Here, we continue this line of research by studying the dependence of the average-case complexity of the k-CLIQUE problem on the parameter k. To this end, we define two natural parameterized analogs of efficient average-case algorithms. We then show that k-CLIQUE admits both analogues for Erclos-Renyi random graphs of arbitrary density. We also show that k-CLIQUE is unlikely to admit either of these analogs for some specific computable input distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
