This problem is NP-hard, and thus many efforts have been made to find a constant factor approximation algorithm for it, but never succeeded so far with arbitrary k >= 3 and m >= 1 pair. We propose a new strategy for computing a smaller-size 3-connected m-dominating set in a unit disk graph with any m >= 1. We show the approximation ratio of our algorithm is constant and its running time is polynomial. We also conduct a simulation to examine the average performance of our algorithm. Our result implies that while there exists a constant factor approximation algorithm for the k-connected m-dominating set problem with arbitrary k <= 3 and m >= 1 pair, the k-connected m-dominating set problem is still open with k > 3.", "paper_title": "On Construction of Quality Fault-Tolerant Virtual Backbone in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329994300012"}
