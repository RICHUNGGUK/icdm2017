The approach was applied to a clinical database consisting of 15 objects. The experimental results showed that this method provided accurate quantitative measurement of dental plaque compared with that of traditional manual measurement indices of the dental plaque.", "paper_title": "Dental plaque quantification using cellular neural network-based image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300094"}
