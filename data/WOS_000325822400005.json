We resolve all of the appropriate length and time scales to solve the coupled fluid, heat, and mass-transfer equations. A recently developed homogeneous nucleation model is used to represent the formation of zinc nanoparticles. The jets are composed of hot metal vapor diluted in nitrogen issuing into a cooler, co-flowing stream. Nucleation occurs along the outer regions of the jet with regions over which nucleation occurs increasing significantly after collapse of the jet potential core.", "paper_title": "Metal particle nucleation in turbulent jets visualization of the large and small scales", "paper_id": "WOS:000325822400005"}
