More precisely, we suppose that the normal vectors are measured at independent random locations uniformly distributed along the boundary of our convex set. Given a desired Hausdorff error eta, we provide upper bounds on the number of probes that one has to perform in order to obtain an eta-approximation of this convex set with high probability. Our result relies on the stability theory related to Minkowski's theorem.", "paper_title": "On the Reconstruction of Convex Sets from Random Normal Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895200005"}
