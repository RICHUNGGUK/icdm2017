Olex supports a hypothesis language of the form \"if T(1) or ... or T(n) occurs in document d, and none of T(n+1), ... T(n+m) occurs in d, then classify d under category c,\" where each T(i) is a conjunction of terms. The proposed method is simple and elegant. Despite this, the results of a systematic experimentation performed on the REUTERS-21578, the OHSUMED, and the ODP data collections show that Olex provides classifiers that are accurate, compact, and comprehensible. A comparative analysis conducted against some of the most well-known learning algorithms (namely, Naive Bayes, Ripper, C4.5, SVM, and Linear Logistic Regression) demonstrates that it is more than competitive in terms of both predictive accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Olex: Effective Rule Learning for Text Categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000267122600003"}
