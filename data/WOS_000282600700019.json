There exist the parameter uncertainties in both the state and input matrices, as well as the unmatched external disturbance. The key feature of this work is the integration of SMC method with H-infinity, technique such that the robust asymptotically stability with a prescribed disturbance attenuation level gamma can be achieved. A sufficient condition for the existence of the desired SMC is obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The reachability of the specified switching surface is proven. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity Robust T-S Fuzzy Design for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems with State Delays Based on Sliding Mode Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000282600700019"}
