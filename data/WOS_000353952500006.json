This problem has been solved previously considering accurate data available. But in a real-world the available knowledge about some data and parameters involves a vague nature. In this study, we propose the application of the Soft Computing to model and solve the TTRP when capacity constraints are imprecise. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Solving the Truck and Trailer Routing Problem with Fuzzy Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000353952500006"}
