Two limited cases of deep BEC regime and BEC regime of BCS-BEC crossover, corresponding to the two-body scattering length a(sc) is small enough and large enough, respectively. We derive a simple two-mode model that could depict the dynamics effectively. With making thorough analysis on the two-mode model and its corresponding classical Hamiltonian, we find that the Josephson oscillation or self-trapping phenomenon could emerge at certain parameters. We find three kinds of the phase states: Josephson oscillation (JO), oscillating-phase-type self-trapping (OPTST) and running-phase-type self-trapping (RPTST). The dependence of these three phase states on the dimensionless interaction parameter y = 1/(k(F)a(sc)) and the initial system energy are given in this paper.", "paper_title": "THE EFFECTS OF THE BEYOND MEAN FIELD CORRECTIONS OF FERMI SUPERFLUID GAS IN A DOUBLE-WELL POTENTIAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000310802600005"}
