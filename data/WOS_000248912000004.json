The software developed combines three tools: a dynamic geometry software to explore, measure, and invent conjectures; an automatic theorem prover to check facts; and an interactive proof system (Coq) to mechanically check proofs built interactively by the user.", "paper_title": "A graphical user interface for formal proofs in geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000248912000004"}
