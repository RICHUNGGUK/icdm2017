In this paper, we focus on double squares, that is, the polyominoes that tile the plane in exactly two distinct ways. Our approach is based on solving equations on words, which allows us to exhibit properties about their shape. Moreover, we describe two infinite families of double squares. The first one is directly linked to Christoffel words and may be interpreted as segments of thick straight lines. The second one stems from the Fibonacci sequence and reveals some fractal features.
