Each request is associated with a service grade. The goal is to maintain certain service levels for the requests of all grades. The service levels are measured in terms of their acceptance ratios. We solve this network optimization problem by adopting a penalty-based framework, in which network design and operation goals can be evaluated based on cost/revenue. We propose a static GoS differentiation model as one minimizing the total rejection and cost penalty, in which the rejection penalty reflects the revenue of accepting a request, and the cost penalty reflects the resource consumption of providing a lightpath to a request. Then, a solution based on the Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient methods is used to solve the proposed optimization problem. Three different application scenarios are presented: static GoS differentiation of requests between the same node pair, static GoS differentiation of requests between different node pairs, and an integration of static GoS differentiation into the network profit objective. The fairness issues and the impact of relative penalty factors are discussed to provide guidelines for network planning. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
