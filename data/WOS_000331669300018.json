Different from local methods operating on local regions of images, the non-local methods utilize non-local information (even the whole image) to accomplish image denoising. Due to their superior performance, the non-local methods have recently drawn more and more attention in the image denoising community. However, these methods generally do not work well in handling complicated noises with different levels and types. Inspired by the fact in machine learning field that multi-kernel methods are more robust and effective in tackling complex problems than single-kernel ones, we establish a general non-local denoising model based on multi-kernel-induced measures (GNLMKIM for short), which provides us a platform to analyze some existing and design new filters. With the help of GNLMKIM, we reinterpret two well-known non-local filters in the united view and extend them to their novel multi-kernel counterparts. The comprehensive experiments indicate that these novel filters achieve encouraging denoising results in both visual effect and PSNR index. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
