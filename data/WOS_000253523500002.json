We propose an adapted new skewed associative architecture as an attempt to alleviate this problem. It has already been shown that skewed associative caches can reduce the rate of conflict misses by using different hash functions to index different banks. Building on this observation, we propose yet another approach to further reduce the rate of conflict misses, nicknamed YAARC (Yet Another Approach to Reducing Conflicts) that uses different hash functions to index into a single bank. Mathematical modeling and simulation results are exploited to evaluate the impact of YAARC on the rate of conflict misses. Mathematical analysis show the superiority of YAARC caches over set and skewed associative caches from the conflict miss point of view. Simulations, using some benchmarks from SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suit that former researchers have reported them as the best candidates for cache performance evaluation, also show nearly 43% conflict miss rate improvement for the skewed associative cache over the set associative cache, and nearly 31% improvement for the YAARC cache over the skewed associative cache. This implies that YAARC caches considerably outperform set and skewed associative caches from the conflict miss point of view. Since production of YAARC caches require a dispensable amount of hardware overhead, they can be considered as a cost effective approach to minimize the rate of conflict misses.", "paper_title": "YAARC: yet another approach to further reducing the rate of conflict misses", "paper_id": "WOS:000253523500002"}
