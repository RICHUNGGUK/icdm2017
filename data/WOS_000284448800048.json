In this paper a construction for optimal (v {3 4} 1{s/(s+1) 1/(s+1)}) OOCs is given. For s = 2 it is proved that for each prime v 1 (mod 24) there exists a (v) {3 4} 1 (2/3 1/3}) OOC. A recursive construction for cyclic difference family is also presented. By using these constructions a number of new infinite classes of optimal (v {3 4} 1 Q) OOCs for Q = {1/2 1/2} and {2/3 1/3} are constructed.", "paper_title": "New Classes of Optimal Variable-Weight Optical Orthogonal Codes Based on Cyclic Difference Families", "paper_id": "WOS:000284448800048"}
