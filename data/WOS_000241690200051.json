Based on user logs which contain over 80 million queries and corresponding click through data, we found that query type identification benefits from click through data analysis; while anchor text information may not be so useful because it is only accessible for a small part (about 16%) of practical user queries. We also proposed two novel features extracted from click through data and a decision tree based classification algorithm for identifying user queries. Our experimental evaluation shows that this algorithm can correctly identify the goals for about 80% web search queries.(1)", "paper_title": "Automatic query type identification based on click through information", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200051"}
