One of our main results states that for pa parts per thousand(a)n (-1) a random 2-complex Y collapses simplicially to a graph and, in particular, the fundamental group pi (1)(Y) is free and H (2)(Y)=0, asymptotically almost surely. Our other main result gives a precise threshold for collapsibility of a random 2-complex to a graph in a prescribed number of steps. We also prove that, if the probability parameter p satisfies pa parts per thousand << n (-1/2+I mu) , where I mu > 0, then an arbitrary finite two-dimensional simplicial complex admits a topological embedding into a random 2-complex, with probability tending to one as n -> a. We also establish several related results; for example, we show that for p < c/n with c < 3 the fundamental group of a random 2-complex contains a non-abelian free subgroup. Our method is based on exploiting explicit thresholds (established in the paper) for the existence of simplicial embeddings and immersions of 2-complexes into a random 2-complex.", "paper_title": "Topology of Random 2-Complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000298297500006"}
