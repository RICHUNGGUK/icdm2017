The gray scale image of ocular fundus is utilized to extract the skeletons of its blood vessels. The cross points on the skeletons are used to match two fundus images. Experiments show high recognition rate, low recognition rejection rate,as well as good universality, exclusiveness and stability of this method.", "paper_title": "Recognition for ocular fundus based on shape of blood vessel", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000012"}
