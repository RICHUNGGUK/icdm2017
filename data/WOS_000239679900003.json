The research on this model has been started by Bohman and colleagues (Random Struct Algor 22 (2003), 33-42; Random Struct Algor 24 (2004), 105-117). Here we obtain a sharp threshold for the appearance of a fixed subgraph and for certain Ramsey properties. We also consider a related model of random k-SAT formulas, where an instance is obtained by adding random k-clauses to a fixed formula with a given number of clauses, and derive tight bounds for the non-satisfiability of the thus-obtained random formula.
