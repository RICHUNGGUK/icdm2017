The architecture robustly determines the total accumulated chromatic dispersion, the symbol rate that is not tightly constrained, the number of distinct modulated polarizations, and the modulation format using higher-order statistics of the sampled signal. Thus, unknown signals from noncooperating transmitters, including legacy transmitters, can be optimally demodulated yielding minimum BER. Experimental single-channel signals transmitted through 1056 km of large-area fiber are demodulated with the new autonomous receiver with essentially identical performance compared to receivers with prior knowledge of the modulation format.", "paper_title": "Robust Architecture for Autonomous Coherent Optical Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000361204300004"}
