In addition, these indifferentiability results do not depend on the Merkle-Damgard (MD) strengthening in the padding functionality of the hash functions. We propose a generic n-bit-iterated hash function framework based on an n-bit compression function called suffix-free-prefix-free (SFPF) that works for arbitrary I Vs and does not possess MD strengthening. We formally prove that SFPF is indifferentiable from a random oracle (RO) when the compression function is viewed as a fixed input-length random oracle (FIL-RO). We show that some hash function constructions proposed in the literature fit in the SFPF framework while others that do not fit in this framework are not indifferentiable from a RO. We also show that the SFPF hash function framework with the provision of MD strengthening generalizes any n-bit-iterated hash function based on an n-bit compression function and with an n-bit chaining value that is proven indifferentiable from a RO.", "paper_title": "The suffix-free-prefix-free hash function construction and its indifferentiability security analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000313726000004"}
