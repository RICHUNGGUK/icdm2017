Based on the BRICs' patents granted by the USPTO, we find (1) the BRICs gradually increased their roles in the global innovation arena with various degrees of internationalization; (2) the domestic-dominant pattern has widely countered the foreign dominance of innovation, while the collaborative multi-dominant pattern has increased; (3) a divergence of the BRICs' global innovation output growth emerged, while their internationalization pattern portfolios evolved towards greater similarity; and (4) China has differentiated itself by increasing its global innovation influence.", "paper_title": "How do the BRIC countries play their roles in the global innovation arena?
