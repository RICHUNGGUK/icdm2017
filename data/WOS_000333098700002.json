In this paper, the extreme learning strategy is introduced to develop a fast training algorithm for interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic systems. The proposed algorithm, called type-2 fuzzy extreme learning algorithm (T2FELA), has two distinctive characteristics. First, the parameters of the antecedents are randomly generated and parameters of the consequents are obtained by a fast learning method according to the extreme learning mechanism. In addition, because the obtained parameters are optimal in the sense of minimizing the norm, the resulting fuzzy systems exhibit better generalization performance. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the training speed of the proposed T2FELA algorithm is superior to that of the existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed algorithm also shows competitive performance in generalization abilities.", "paper_title": "T2FELA: Type-2 Fuzzy Extreme Learning Algorithm for Fast Training of Interval Type-2 TSK Fuzzy Logic System", "paper_id": "WOS:000333098700002"}
