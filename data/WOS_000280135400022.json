The main idea of our approach is to leverage curve skeletons to detect the inconsistency of a mesh sequence. The skeleton of one mesh in the sequence is edited by user, which produces a prototype skeleton. We propagate this prototype using graph matching in-between frames. By using temporal coherence cues, the matching procedure can be dramatically accelerated. Finally, the mesh sequence is repaired according to the inconsistencies by comparing matched skeletons and original skeletons. As demonstrated in the results, our approach avoids manually editing in all meshes, and is able to output a mesh sequence with consistent topology.
