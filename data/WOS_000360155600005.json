In some scientific contexts, there is a need to be able to create and use such simulations to explore and generate hypotheses alongside conventional laboratory research. The principled complex systems modelling and simulation (CoSMoS) approach was created to support these activities, as a response to a perceived gap in the software engineering development process for simulation. The article presents some of the software engineering motivation for CoSMoS, by exploring this perceived gap. Following from this analysis, the article considers the validation of complex systems simulators, especially where these are to be used in ongoing research.", "paper_title": "Filling gaps in simulation of complex systems: the background and motivation for CoSMoS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360155600005"}
