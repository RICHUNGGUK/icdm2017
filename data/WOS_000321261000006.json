In this paper, we propose a novel approach, namely DPMFP, to discover the latent cluster structure based on the DPM model without requiring the number of clusters as input. Document features are automatically partitioned into two groups, in particular, discriminative words and nondiscriminative words, and contribute differently to document clustering. A variational inference algorithm is investigated to infer the document collection structure as well as the partition of document words at the same time. Our experiments indicate that our proposed approach performs well on the synthetic data set as well as real data sets. The comparison between our approach and state-of-the-art document clustering approaches shows that our approach is robust and effective for document clustering.", "paper_title": "Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for Document Clustering with Feature Partition", "paper_id": "WOS:000321261000006"}
