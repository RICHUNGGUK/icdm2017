The T/R switch uses 6-stacked body-floated N-MOSFETs to enhance linearity, and a negative-voltage controller integrated on a single die with the power switch cell. A complementary DICSON charge pump is employed to generate the negative voltages and three-step level shifters are used to control the switch cell. The fabricated T/R switch has P-1dB of 33.8 and 32.6 dBm at 900 and 1,800 MHz from a 2 V supply, respectively. The insertion losses of TX are 0.7 and 1.1 dB at 900 and 1,800 MHz, respectively. The isolations from TX to ANT and RX to ANT are > 25 dB at both frequencies, and the return losses are > 20 dB. The proposed T/R switch shows comparable or better performance compared to the previously reported T/R switches without the switch controller.", "paper_title": "A fully integrated 33.8-dBm bulk CMOS T/R switch with a negative-voltage switch controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000023"}
