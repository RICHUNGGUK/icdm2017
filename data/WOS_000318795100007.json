In sequential data analysis this interest has also been growing, but rather crude algorithms have been applied: either Monte Carlo filters or brute-force discretisations. These approaches scale poorly and clearly show a missing gap: no generic analogues to Kalman filters are currently available in non-Euclidean domains. In this paper, we remedy this issue by first generalising the unscented transform and then the unscented Kalman filter to Riemannian manifolds. As the Kalman filter can be viewed as an optimisation algorithm akin to the Gauss-Newton method, our algorithm also provides a general-purpose optimisation framework on manifolds. We illustrate the suggested method on synthetic data to study robustness and convergence, on a region tracking problem using covariance features, an articulated tracking problem, a mean value optimisation and a pose optimisation problem.", "paper_title": "Unscented Kalman Filtering on Riemannian Manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000318795100007"}
