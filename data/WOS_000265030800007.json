This language has been designed to cope with the three dimensions involved in the problem of software specification: (i) mathematical operations, (ii) event/process timing, and (iii) memory manipulation. In this paper we focus on giving a testing semantics to the second dimension: Process timing dimension. First, we will provide a SOS like operational semantics for the process relations of RTPA. Next, we will define what a test is and we will introduce a relation based on which tests are passed by processes. Finally, we will obtain an operational characterization that can be used as a first step to define a denotational sematics sound and complete with respect the testing semantics.", "paper_title": "Testing Semantics for RTPA", "paper_id": "WOS:000265030800007"}
