It is shown that the proposed approach can identify the inherent distribution and the dependence structure for each 3D object along multiple view angles by evaluating the local topological segments with a dipole topology model and developing the relevant mathematical criterion with ELM algorithm. The ELM ensemble is then used to combine the individual single-hidden layer feedforward neural network of each 3D object for performance improvements. The simulation results have shown the excellent performance and the effectiveness of the developed scheme.", "paper_title": "3D object recognition based on a geometrical topology model and extreme learning machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300002"}
