For density matrices which include only two-qubits correlations the number of HS parameters is reduced to 3 by using local rotations, and for two-qubits states which include single qubit measurements, the number of parameters is reduced to 4 by local Lorentz transformations. For both cases, we related the absolute values of the HS parameters to probabilities, and the outer products of various Pauli matrices were transformed to pure state density matrices products. We discuss related problems for three-qubits. For n-qubits correlation systems (n >= 2) the sufficient condition for separability may be improved by local transformations, related to high order singular value decompositions (SVDs).", "paper_title": "Explicit constructions of all separable two-qubits density matrices and related problems for three-qubits systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000372296400003"}
