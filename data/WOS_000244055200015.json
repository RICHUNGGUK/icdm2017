Inspired by the advantages of quantum computation, the state/action in a RL system is represented with quantum superposition state. The probability of action eigenvalue is denoted by probability amplitude, which is updated according to rewards. And the action selection is carried out by observing quantum state according to collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The results of simulated experiments show that quantum computation can be effectively used to action selection and decision making through speeding up learning. This method also makes a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation for RL using probability characteristics of quantum theory.", "paper_title": "Quantum computation for action selection using reinforcement learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000244055200015"}
