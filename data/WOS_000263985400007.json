We propose a sensor network protocol for this purpose, in which sensor nodes operate on a low duty cycle while the latency of transmission is guaranteed to be less than it certain bound. In this protocol, each node is assigned a time slot in which it receives messages from other nodes. To accomplish slot assignment where nodes further from a BS are assigned earlier time slots for a packet to be transmitted to the BS in one cycle, we propose a slot assignment function with which a node can determine its own slot in a distributed way. We explore several slot assignment functions to find one which gives low and homogeneous contention over a grid network. The simulation results show that our protocol performs well close to the optimal case.", "paper_title": "A Sensor Network Protocol for Automatic Meter Reading in an Apartment Building", "paper_id": "WOS:000263985400007"}
