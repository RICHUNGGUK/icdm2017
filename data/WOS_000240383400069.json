Multiple models, which are obtained by using advanced K-means clustering and PLS method, are used to describe the different environments and will be switched according to the value of distance coefficient to calculate the control action. The proposed MMPC strategy is applied in pH neutralization process and the simulation results demonstrate its validity.", "paper_title": "Multi-model predictive control based on a new clustering modeling method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400069"}
