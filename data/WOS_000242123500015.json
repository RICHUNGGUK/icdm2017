In most ER research, the sensory - motor mappings of robots are represented as artificial neural networks, and their connection weights ( and sometimes the structure of the networks) can be optimized in the parameter spaces by using evolutionary computation. However, generally, the evolved neural controllers could be fragile in unexperienced environments, especially in real worlds, because the evolutionary optimization processes would be executed in idealized simulators. This is known as the gap problem between the simulated and real worlds. To overcome this, the author focused on evolving an on-line learning ability instead of weight parameters in a simulated environment. According to recent biological findings, actually, the kinds of on-line adaptation abilities can be found in real nervous systems of insects and crustaceans, and it is also known that a variety of neuromodulators (NMs) play crucial roles to regulate the network characteristics (i.e. activating/ blocking/changing of synaptic connections). Based on this, a neuromodulatory neural network model was proposed and it was utilized as a mobile robot controller. In the paper, the detail behavior analysis of the evolved neuromodulatory neural network is also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
