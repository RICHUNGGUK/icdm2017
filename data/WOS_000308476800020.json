Notice the point that this method is used for fuzzy integro-differential equations with trapezoid fuzzy initial value. The idea of the presented approach is constructed based on the extending of 0-cut and 1-cut solutions of original FIDEs. The solution of FIDE will be found by considering convex combination of 0-cut and 1-cut solutions. The obtained solution will be exact by choosing the different types of derivatives.", "paper_title": "A new method for solving fuzzy integro-differential equation under generalized differentiability", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800020"}
