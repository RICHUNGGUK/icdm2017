Long term evolution (LTE) systems, which can offer up to 100Mbps downlink date rates, have been deployed in USA and Korea. However, because plenty of complex physical layer algorithms are utilized, network planning and optimization become heavy burdens for LTE network operators. Self-organizing network (SON) is a promising method to overcome this problem by automatically selecting and adjusting key parameters in LTE systems. In this paper, we present a dynamic adjusting algorithm to improve both handover and load balancing performance by introducing a weighted co-satisfaction factor (CSF). Analysis and system level simulation are conducted to exhibit the performance improvement of the proposed scheme. Results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional solutions in terms of the network handover success ratio and load balancing gains significantly.", "paper_title": "A Novel Dynamic Adjusting Algorithm for Load Balancing and Handover Co-Optimization in LTE SON", "paper_id": "WOS:000318509400006"}
