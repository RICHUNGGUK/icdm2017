Recently, a new concept, referred to as service vector, has been introduced to enhance the end-to-end QoS granularity, and at the same time, maintain the simplicity and scalability feature of the current differentiated services (DiffServ) networks. This work extends this concept to wireless ad hoc networks and proposes a cross-layer architecture based on the combination of delay-bounded wireless link level scheduling and the network layer service vector concept, resulting in significant power savings and finer end-to-end QoS granularity. The impact of various traffic arrival distributions and flows with different QoS requirements on the performance of this cross-layer architecture is also investigated and evaluated.
