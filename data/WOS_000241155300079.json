In order to make procurement decisions, a contractor requires access to product information from several different product suppliers when constructing artefacts such as a hospital, or an office block. This product information is available from the online systems of product suppliers. However, this approach requires a contractor to visit several websites in order to find the right product which is time consuming and the product data available from different product suppliers is heterogeneous. The MDSSF architecture provides an integrated means of accessing product information from a large number of product suppliers using a single system. It brings together autonomous product suppliers to share product information with the federation users such as contractors and potential buyers using a common data model. It also creates an environment for product suppliers to compete with each other in a virtual market place based on the product information they provide to federation users. The MDSSF gives its users a Grid enabled database search mechanism for searching a large number of supplier databases in real time and protects product related sensitive data from exposure to business competitors. We describe the architecture and distinctive features of the MDSSF.", "paper_title": "MDSSF - A federated architecture for product procurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300079"}
