This is a recent and challenging problem, which must deal with different degrees of kinship and variations in age and gender. Our work explores the computer identification of parent-child pairs using a combination of (i) features of different natures, based on geometric and textural data, (ii) feature selection and (iii) state-of-the-art classifiers. Experiments show that the proposed approach provides a valuable solution to the kinship verification problem, as suggested by its comparison with different methods on the same data and the same experimental protocols. We further show the good generalization capabilities of our method in several cross-database experiments.", "paper_title": "Geometric and Textural Cues for Automatic Kinship Verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000353551500009"}
