The obtained results are very encouraging, our results improved the performance obtained using the stand-alone classifiers. We show that the method \"Random Subspace\" outperforms the other ensemble methods tested in this paper. Moreover, the best stand-alone method is the multi-layer perceptron neural net, while the best method tested in this work is the Random Subspace of Levenberg-Marquardt neural net. In this work, three financial datasets are chosen for the experiments: Australian credit, German credit, and Japanese credit. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
