Therefore, tools are desirable that help application developers by automatically locating inefficiencies. We present Periscope, a system for automated performance analysis based on the notion of performance properties. We present the overall architecture of Periscope, which consists of a set of analysis agents and show how properties of OpenMP applications are detected. We describe the set of OpenMP properties we have defined so far and the data model used in the specification of these properties. Practical tests on the feasibility of our approach are performed with a number of OpenMP applications.", "paper_title": "Finding inefficiencies in OpenMP applications automatically with Periscope", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400067"}
