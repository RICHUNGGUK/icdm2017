We first propose an integer programming formulation based on the reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). We then use the idea of partitioning spanning trees into forests of a given fixed size and obtain a QMSTP reformulation that generalizes the RLT model. The reformulation is such that the larger the size of the forests, the stronger lower bounds provided. Thus, a hierarchy of formulations is obtained. At the lowest hierarchy level, one has precisely the RLT formulation, which is already stronger than previous formulations in the literature. The highest hierarchy level provides the convex hull of integer feasible solutions for the problem. The formulations introduced here are not compact, so the direct evaluation of their linear programming relaxation bounds is not practical. To overcome that, we introduce two lower bounding procedures based on Lagrangian relaxation. These procedures are embedded into two parallel branch-and-bound algorithms. As a result of our study, several instances in the literature were solved to optimality for the first time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
