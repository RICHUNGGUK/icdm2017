First, to reduce redundant communication links while preserving global connectivity, a distributed link removal algorithm is developed that only requires local information of no more than two-hop neighbors. Secondly, for the purpose of preserving essential links while avoiding collisions, a combined piecewise-continuous motion controller is designed to regulate the motion of mobile sensors between two consecutive switches. The proposed hybrid control system can autonomously disperse a team of mobile sensors towards their final configuration with guaranteed connectivity and collision avoidance. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations have confirmed the efficiency and scalability of the proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "Self-Organized Connectivity Control and Optimization Subjected to Dispersion of Mobile Ad Hoc Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000311156000001"}
