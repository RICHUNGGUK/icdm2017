However, the locations of gateways need to be carefully selected to maximize the benefit in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we present our formulation of the surface gateway deployment problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) and we solve the problem with heuristic approaches to provide a realtime solution for large scale deployment problems. By applying the proposed heuristic algorithms to a variety of deployment scenarios, we show that they are nearly optimal for practical cases, which opens the door for dynamic deployment. Therefore, we extend our solution to a dynamic case and propose a modified framework that integrates Aqua-sim, a NS2-based underwater wireless sensor network simulator. Our simulation result shows the benefits of dynamic gateway redeployment over static deployment. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
