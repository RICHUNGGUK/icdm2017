In this paper, we propose a novel motion track representation to represent the motion track in the X-Y plane and the trend of velocity changes. Moreover, a new similarity measure for comparing two motion tracks based on the representation is proposed. Furthermore, the motion track segmentation method is proposed to handle a complicated motion behavior and the relevance feedback is used to improve the query results.", "paper_title": "Similarity-based motion track management for video retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000242243500013"}
