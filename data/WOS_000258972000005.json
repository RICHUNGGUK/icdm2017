Based on the eddy-damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM) theory, a stochastic model is developed in order to predict the time evolution of the kinetic energy spectrum obtained by a large-eddy simulation (LES), including the effects of the numerics. Using this framework, the influence of the accuracy of the approximate space differencing schemes on LES quality is studied, for decaying homogeneous isotropic incompressible turbulence, with Reynolds numbers Re; based on the transverse Taylor scale equal to 780, 2500 and 8000. The results show that the discretization of the filtered Navier-Stokes equations leads to differentiation and aliasing errors. Error spectra are also presented, and indicate that the numerical errors are mainly originating from the approximate differentiation. In addition, increasing the order of accuracy of the differencing schemes or using algorithms optimized in the Fourier space is found to widen the range of well-resolved scales. Unfortunately, for all the schemes, the smaller scales with wavenumbers close to the grid cut-off wavenumber, are badly calculated and generate differentiation errors over the whole energy spectrum. The eventual use of explicit filtering to remove spurious motions with short wavelength is finally shown to significantly improve LES accuracy. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
