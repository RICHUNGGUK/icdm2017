Several optimization solutions combined with cloud computing technologies have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks. However, these approaches only consider the SPARQL Basic Graph Pattern processing, and their file system-based schema can barely modify large-scale RDF data randomly. This paper presents a scalable SPARQL Group Graph Pattern (GGP) processing framework for large RDF graphs. We design a novel storage schema on HBase to store RDF data. Furthermore, a query plan generation algorithm is proposed to determine jobs based on a greedy selection strategy. Several query algorithms are also presented to answer SPARQL GGP queries in the MapReduce paradigm. An experiment on a simulation cloud computing environment shows that our framework is more scalable and efficient than traditional approaches when storing and retrieving large volumes of RDF data.", "paper_title": "SCALABLE RDF GRAPH QUERYING USING CLOUD COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000315305100006"}
