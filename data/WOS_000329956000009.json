The proposed techniques benefit from the existence of temporal correlation across consecutive MFCC frames as well as the presence of intra-frame redundancy. We present DVQ schemes based on linear prediction and non-linear methods with multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). In addition to this, we propose the use of a multipath search coding strategy based on the M-algorithm that obtains the sequence of centroids that minimize the quantization error globally instead of selecting the centroids that minimize the quantization error locally in a frame by frame basis. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed methods for two different tasks. On the one hand, two small-size vocabulary databases, Spechdat-Car and Aurora 2, have been considered obtaining negligible degradation in terms of Word Accuracy (around 1%) compared to the unquantized scheme for bit-rates as low as 0.5 kbps. On the other hand, for a large vocabulary task (Aurora 4), the proposed method achieves a WER comparable to the unquantized scheme only with 1.6 kbps. Moreover, we propose a combined scheme (differential/non-differential) that allows the system to present the same sensitivity to transmission errors than previous multi-frame coding proposals for DSR.
