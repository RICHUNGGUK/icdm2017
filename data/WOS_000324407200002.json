We find that discrete modulation protocols with more than eight states do not perform better than the eight-state protocol. Then, we study the improvement of this protocol by using a nondeterministic noiseless linear amplifier (NLA) on Bob's detection stage. Results indicate that a NLA with gain g can extend the maximum transmission distance by 50 log(10)g(2) km and can increase the maximal tolerable excess noise. With the reconciliation efficiency beta, we find the gain of NLA has a maximal value defined as g(max) and by adjusting the gain to about beta g(max) one can have the best improvement on secret key rate.", "paper_title": "DISCRETELY MODULATED CONTINUOUS-VARIABLE QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION WITH A NONDETERMINISTIC NOISELESS AMPLIFIER", "paper_id": "WOS:000324407200002"}
