Existing methods for doing this have various limitations. In this paper, we propose a new turbulence method that uses a refined second vorticity confinement method, referred to as robust second vorticity confinement, and a synthesis scheme to create highly turbulent effects from coarse grid. The new technique is sufficiently stable to efficiently produce highly turbulent flows, while allowing intuitive control of vortical structures. Second vorticity confinement captures and defines the vortical features of turbulence on a coarse grid. However, due to the stability problem, it cannot be used to produce highly turbulent flows. In this work, we propose a robust formulation to improve the stability problem by making the positive diffusion term to vary with helicity adaptively. In addition, we also employ our new method to procedurally synthesize the high-resolution flow fields. As shown in our results, this approach produces stable high-resolution turbulence very efficiently.", "paper_title": "Synthetic Controllable Turbulence Using Robust Second Vorticity Confinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000315301700004"}
