We propose that user goals direct visualization use tasks, but the strength of user motivation is modified by promoting and inhibiting factors. Based on the duration and frequency of use for reported artifacts, we hypothesize that artifact use patterns depend on how promoters and inhibitors change over time, and we propose a six-stage model of artifact use. We hypothesize that the differences in how these artifacts were used ultimately reveals how promoters and inhibitors can be manipulated to promote frequent and long-duration visualization use. This model provides a cognitive framework for visualization designers and suggests new research directions.", "paper_title": "Exploring how and why people use visualizations in casual contexts: Modeling user goals and regulated motivations", "paper_id": "WOS:000303622600002"}
