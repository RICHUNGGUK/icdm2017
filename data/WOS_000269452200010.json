The resistance and inductance of a square PCB inductor are calculated in this paper. For this a multiconductor transmission-line model is constructed and its coupling integral equations are given. These equations are solved by wavelet-MoM, in which a [0, 1] Coifman intervallic scarlet is used. Finally, the inductance and resistance versus frequency plots are presented.", "paper_title": "PCB INDUCTOR IMPEDANCE CALCULATION BASED ON WAVELET-MoM", "paper_id": "WOS:000269452200010"}
