Design/methodology/approach - Based on the real data of a distribution center in Utica, Michigan, USA, the design of VRP is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem which considers three objectives. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 11 (NSGA-II) is adopted to solve this multi-objective problem. On the other hand, the VRP model is simulated and an object-oriented idea is employed to analyze the classes, functions, and attributes of all involved objects on VRP. A modularized objectification model is established on AnyLogic software, which can simulate the practical distribution process by changing parameters dynamically and randomly. The simulation model automatically controls vehicles motion by programs, and has strong expansibility. Meanwhile, the model credibility is strengthened by introducing random traffic flow to simulate practical traffic conditions. Findings - The computational results show that the NSGA-II algorithm is effective in solving this practical problem. Moreover, the simulation results suggest that by analyzing and controlling specific key factors of VRP, the distribution center can get useful information for vehicle scheduling and touring. Originality/value - Multi-objective problems are seldom considered on VRPs, yet they are of great practical value in logistics distribution. This paper is mainly focused on multi-objective VRP which is derived from a practical distribution center. The NSGA-II algorithm is applied in this problem and the AnyLogic software is employed as the simulation tool. In addition, this paper deals with several key factors of VRP in order to control and simulate the distribution process. The computational and simulation results regarding VRPs constitute the main contribution of our paper.", "paper_title": "Simulation on vehicle routing problems in logistics distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000273285900012"}
