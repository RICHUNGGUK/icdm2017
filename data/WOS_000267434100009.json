Without the location information, node placement and spiral movement policies are proposed for the robot to deploy sensors efficiently to achieve power conservation and full coverage, while an obstacle surrounding movement policy is proposed to reduce the impacts of an obstacle upon deployment. Simulation results reveal that the proposed robot-deployment algorithm outperforms most existing robot-deployment mechanisms in power conservation and obstacle resistance and therefore achieves a better deployment performance.", "paper_title": "An Obstacle-Free and Power-Efficient Deployment Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000267434100009"}
