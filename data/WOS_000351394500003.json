There is one big problem that when system dispatches the elevator to the button responding floor, but corridor passenger is no there. In this paper, we present a novel elevator group control algorithm based on binocular-cameras corridor passenger detection and tracking, aiming to overcome the difficulty in the conventional elevator group control system. In the above proposed system, the corridor passengers are detected using Haar-like features based on binocular-cameras, and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is introduced to improve robustness and accuracy of corridor passenger motion tracking. A new elevator group control strategy based on corridor passenger detection and tracking is proposed to improve the performance and transport efficiency of the elevator service. Compared with the traditional elevator group control system, the proposed system has potential advantages in minimizing passengers' waiting time and saving electronic energy. The final experimental results show the validity of our method under simulation and realistic condition.", "paper_title": "A novel elevator group control algorithm based on binocular-cameras corridor passenger detection and tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000351394500003"}
