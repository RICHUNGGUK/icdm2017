Identifying the appropriate method components for supporting aspect-oriented development is facilitated by the use of a method engineering approach. We demonstrate this approach by using the OPEN Process Framework (OPF) to identify previous deficiencies in the method fragments stored in the OPF repository so that the enhanced OPF repository is able to fully support AOSD.
