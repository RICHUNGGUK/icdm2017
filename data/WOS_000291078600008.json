Although the OPAC of these library automation packages provides advanced features of searching and retrieval of bibliographic records, none of them facilitate full-text searching. Most of the available open-source digital library software facilitates indexing and searching of full-text documents in different formats. This paper makes an effort to enable full-text search features in the widely used open-source library automation package Koha, by integrating it with two open-source digital library software packages, Greenstone Digital Library Software (GSDL) and Fedora Generic Search Service (FGSS), independently. Design/methodology/approach - The implementation is done by making use of the Search and Retrieval by URL (SRU) feature available in Koha, GSDL and FGSS. The full-text documents are indexed both in Koha and GSDL and FGSS. Findings - Full-text searching capability in Koha is achieved by integrating either GSDL or FGSS into Koha and by passing an SRU request to GSDL or FGSS from Koha. The full-text documents are indexed both in the library automation package (Koha) and digital library software (GSDL, FGSS) Originality/value - This is the first implementation enabling the full-text search feature in a library automation software by integrating it into digital library software.", "paper_title": "Open-source tools for enhancing full-text searching of OPACs Use of Koha, Greenstone and Fedora", "paper_id": "WOS:000291078600008"}
