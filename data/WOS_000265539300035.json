We propose a GPU-based multi-band method for optimized synthesis of \"far from coast\" ocean waves using an empirical Fourier domain model. Instead of performing two independent syntheses for low- and high-band frequencies of ocean waves, we perform only low-band synthesis and employ results to reproduce high frequency details of ocean surface by an optimized iterative up-sampling stage. Our experimental results show that this approach greatly improves the performance of original multi-band synthesis while maintaining image quality.", "paper_title": "Real-time multi-band synthesis of ocean water with new iterative up-sampling technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300035"}
