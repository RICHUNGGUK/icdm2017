Our construction involves tuples of values that decide the result of aggregation. Absorbent tuples are useful to model situations in which certain decision makers may decide the outcome irrespective of the opinion of the others. We examine the most important classes of aggregation operators in respect to their absorbent tuples, and also construct new aggregation operators with predefined sets of absorbent tuples.
