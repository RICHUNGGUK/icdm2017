We determine the distribution of colors in several paintings by Seurat and quantify a number of the theory that he employs. Using an RYB color wheel and a hierarchical point generation technique, we convert an input image into a set of colored dots, which is again converted into brush strokes with appropriate shapes and directions. We present images which illustrate the extent to which we have managed to simulate Seurat's technique.", "paper_title": "Color juxtaposition for pointillism based on an artistic color model and a statistical analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800004"}
