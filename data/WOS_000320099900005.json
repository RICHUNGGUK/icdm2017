Under the consideration of packet-dropout compensation, a new measurement model is proposed to take the time-varying delay, random packet dropout and quantisation effect into account simultaneously. After properly augmenting the states of the original system and the FD filter, the robust FD problem is formulated as an auxiliary H filtering problem for a stochastic parameter system with time-varying delays and uncertainties. A sufficient condition for the existence of the robust FD filter is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which depends on both the network status and the quantisation density. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust fault detection for networked control systems with nonlinear disturbances and imperfect measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900005"}
