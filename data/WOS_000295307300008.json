A set S of vertices, called the seeds, are active initially. Thereafter, an inactive vertex is activated when at least a rho fraction of its neighbors is active, where rho is an element of (0, 1]. The cascading process proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can be activated. This paper proves the existence of at most (2 root 2 + 3)inverted right perpendicular rho|V|inverted left perpendicular seeds that can activate all vertices at the end. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
