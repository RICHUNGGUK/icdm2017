A structured visual dictionary (SVD) can be learned from both appearance and geometric structure, thereby enhancing its discriminative strength between the foreground object and the background. Experimental results show that the proposed tracking algorithm using SVD (SVDTrack) performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
