In order to prevent torque backlash and intense wear in dry clutch plates, a proper clamp force regulation is used. A full vehicle simulation that includes vehicle and powertrain components is set up. A Fuzzy logic control system is found suitable for clamp force and engine throttle controls. For upshift and downshift cases, the design of controllers for the gearshift process is carried out by defining proper membership functions and Fuzzy rules using Matlab/Simulink(TM) software. The effectiveness of the control system is investigated by simulating two upshift and downshift cases. Results indicate that the control system is successful in regulating the clutch clamp forces and the engine throttle in such a way that a smooth torque flow in the transmission is achieved in all cases.", "paper_title": "Control of a twin clutch transmission for smooth gearshifts", "paper_id": "WOS:000355817600004"}
