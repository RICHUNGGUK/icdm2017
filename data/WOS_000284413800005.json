However, in a real-life vendor-buyer integrated system, a multi-delivery policy is often used in lieu of continuous issuing policy and it is inevitable to generate defective items during a production run. This study addresses these issues by incorporating multiple deliveries of the finished batch, customer's inventory-holding cost and manufacturer's quality assurance cost into an EPQ model with the imperfect reworking of random defective items. Mathematical modelling and analyses are employed. Convexity of the long-run expected cost function is proved by the use of Hessian matrix equations, and the closed-form solutions in terms of the optimal lot size and optimal number of deliveries are obtained. The research results are demonstrated with a numerical example with a discussion on its practical usage.", "paper_title": "Mathematical modelling for determining economic batch size and optimal number of deliveries for EPQ model with quality assurance", "paper_id": "WOS:000284413800005"}
