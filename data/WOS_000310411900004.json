Equivalently, a family of sets F = {Q(l), ... ,Q(m)), where Q(i) subset of R for some universe R, satisfies the C1P if the symbols in R can be permuted such that the elements of each set Q(i) epsilon F occur consecutively, as a contiguous segment of the permutation of R's symbols. Motivated by combinatorial problems on sequences with repeated symbols, we consider the C1P version on multisets and prove that counting the orderings (permutations) thus generated is #P-complete. We prove completeness results also for counting the permutations generated by PQ-trees (which are related to the C1P), thus showing that a polynomial-time algorithm is unlikely to exist when dealing with multisets and sequences with repeated symbols. To prove our results, we use a combinatorial approach based on parsimonious reductions from the Hamiltonian path problem, which enables us to prove also the hardness of approximation for these counting problems.
