In this paper, we present a framework for modeling the human capacity for self-deception from a decision-theoretic perspective in which we describe an integrated process of wishful thinking which includes the determination of a desired belief state, the biasing of internal beliefs towards or away from this desired belief state, and the final decision-making process. Finally, we show that in certain situations self-deception can be beneficial.", "paper_title": "Modeling self-deception within a decision-theoretic framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000273806500002"}
