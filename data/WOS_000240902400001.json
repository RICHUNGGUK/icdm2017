The hardware requirements from the node however are unarguable a big disadvantage of these kinds of nodes. In this paper, we present two all-optical label switching nodes. One is based on the MPLS technology and one is an alternative switching strategy for packet-switching: label stripping. We compare both node architectures in terms of hardware requirements for different switching strategies and network parameters (such as topology and number of nodes).", "paper_title": "Benefits of label stripping compared to label swapping from the point of node dimensioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240902400001"}
