With A-SVNE, we try to satisfy the availability requirement of each virtual component (i.e., a virtual link or a virtual node) in a virtual network. We first analyze the availability of a virtual component based on the availabilities of the substrate link(s) and node(s). Then, we formulate an integer linear programming model for the A-SVNE problem and propose several time-efficient heuristics. Specifically, we design two node mapping strategies: one is sequential selection using efficient weights defined by the availability information, while the other uses auxiliary graphs to transform the problem into a classical problem in graph theory, i.e., the maximum-weight maximum clique. Finally, we use extensive simulations to compare the proposed A-SVNE algorithms with existing ones in terms of the blocking probability, availability gap, and penalty due to service-level agreement violations, and the results indicate that our algorithms perform better.", "paper_title": "Availability-Aware Survivable Virtual Network Embedding in Optical Datacenter Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000367820900018"}
