In CCN, routers are equipped with content stores at the content level, which act as caches for frequently requested content. Based on this design, the Internet is available to provide content distribution services without any application-layer support. In addition, as caches are integrated into routers, the overall performance of CCN will be deeply affected by the caching efficiency. In this paper, our aim is to gain some insights on how caches should be designed to maintain a high performance in a cost-efficient way. We try to model the two-layer cache hierarchy composed of CCN routers using a two-dimensional discrete-time Markov chain, and develop an efficient algorithm to calculate the hit ratios of these caches. Simulations validate the accuracy of our modeling method, and convey some meaningful information which can help us better understand the caching mechanism of CCN.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical caches in content-centric networks: modeling and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000368588400002"}
