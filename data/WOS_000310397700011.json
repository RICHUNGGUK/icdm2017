For decades, speaker adaptation methods have been widely used. All of these adaptation methods need adaptation data. However, our proposed method aims to create speaker-independent acoustic models that cover not only known but also unknown speakers. We achieve this by adopting inverse maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) transformation-based feature generation, and then we train our models using these features. First we obtain MLLR transformation matrices from a limited number of existing speakers. Then we extract the bases of the MLLR transformation matrices using PCA. The distribution of the weight parameters to express the transformation matrices for the existing speakers are estimated. Next, we construct pseudo-speaker transformations by sampling the weight parameters from the distribution, and apply the transformation to the normalized features of the existing speaker to generate the features of the pseudo-speakers. Finally, using these features, we train the acoustic models. Evaluation results show that the acoustic models trained using our proposed method are robust for unknown speakers.", "paper_title": "Acoustic Model Training Using Pseudo-Speaker Features Generated by MLLR Transformations for Robust Speaker-Independent Speech Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397700011"}
