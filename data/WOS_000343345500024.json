The hypothesis of strict inclusion is relaxed by considering a measure of the degree of inclusion. Thus, partial inclusions are also tested. Asymptotic and bootstrap techniques are established. The performance of the bootstrap test is also analyzed by means of some simulations. A case-study regarding the blood pressure classification in adults is considered. 2014 Elsevier Inc.
