Two models were adopted in the proposed approach. One model is based on a hyperbolic nonlinear relationship to simulate the behavior between unit skin friction and pile displacement developed along the pile-soil interface. The other model uses a bilinear hardening model to simulate the load-settlement response developed at the pile base. Based on the two proposed models, a highly effective iterative computer program was developed for nonlinear analysis of the load-settlement behavior of a single pile. Concerning analysis of the response of pile groups, the interaction between two piles was assumed to be composed of two aspects: interaction between pile shafts and interaction between pile bases. Based on this assumption, a reduction coefficient was introduced into the discussion of pile-pile interaction to account for the reinforcing effect between piles. Comparisons of the load-settlement response for three well-instrumented tests were given to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed simple method.
