In this paper, by analyzing the characteristic and weakness of the existing regression methods, using the concept of quasi-linear function with good structure and approximation properties, we establish quasi-linear regression model (denoted by QRM for short). Further we consider the parameter estimation strategy for QRM, propose parameter estimation based on genetic algorithm and the least squares method, do error testing based on residual analysis. Finally, we analyze the performance of the model by an illustrative example. The result indicates that QRM possesses generality and good operability. The regression effect can be satisfied by adjusting the freedom degree of the quasi-linear regression function. Accordingly, it can be widely used in many fields such as artificial intelligence and economic management.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON QUASI-LINEAR REGRESSION METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100020"}
