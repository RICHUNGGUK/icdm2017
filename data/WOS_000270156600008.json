It is shown that the synchronization error is bounded if the local controller can be appropriately designed, and that Such an error is independent of initial conditions. This feature allows synchronizing not only similar chaotic systems but, under certain conditions, different chaotic systems can be synchronized as well. In other words, this approach can be used to obtain either complete or generalized synchronization. Several simulations are carried Out to illustrate how the problem can be solved in a practical way by using the linear matrix inequalities (LMI) technique.
