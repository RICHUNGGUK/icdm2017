Fuzziness in axiomatic design (FAD) has been handled by some researchers to evaluate alternatives under fuzzy environment. In this paper, three important tolls are added FAD method so as to supply its deficiency. The first one is the hierarchy which has the ability of taking the hierarchical structures into account. The second is the crisp toll which has the ability of taking the positive information into consideration under fuzzy environment. The last one is the ranking ability. As a matter of fact, FAD method is developed to be used for the solution of all manners of multi-attribute decision making problems. Moreover, an application to a teaching assistant selection problem is made to show the usability of the developed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
