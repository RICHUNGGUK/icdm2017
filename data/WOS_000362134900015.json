Stacker-reclaimers perform both the stacking and reclaiming of dry bulk materials. Due to the differences in loads between ships and cargo trains, the time needed for stacking and reclaiming varies considerably per job. The simulation tool developed can be used to support decisions when to interrupt ship servicing in favor of train loading based on the availability of transportation routes and expected disturbances. An experimental study demonstrated that ships and trains have to spend less time in the port when the stockyard lanes are accessible by two stacker-reclaimers due to the higher machines redundancy. Using the stacker-reclaimers rescheduling function the average port time of trains decreased without significantly affecting the port time of ships. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
