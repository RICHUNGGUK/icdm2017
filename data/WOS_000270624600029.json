These are data on actual respondents, but with confidential data replaced by multiply-imputed synthetic values. A mis-specified imputation model can invalidate inferences based on the partially synthetic data, because the imputation model determines the distribution of synthetic values. We present a practical method to generate synthetic values when the imputer has only limited information about the true data generating process. We combine a simple imputation model (such as regression) with density-based transformations that preserve the distribution of the confidential data, up to sampling error, on specified subdomains. We demonstrate through simulations and a large scale application that our approach preserves important statistical properties of the confidential data, including higher moments, with low disclosure risk.
