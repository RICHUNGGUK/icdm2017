The architecture consists of newly derived two-level dynamic programming (TLDP) that use only bit addition and shift operations. The advantages of this architecture are the spatial efficiency to accommodate more words with limited space and the absence of multiplications to increase computational speed by reducing propagation delays. The architecture is highly regular, consisting of identical and simple processing elements with only nearest-neighbor communication, and external communication occurs with the end processing elements. In order to verify the proposed architecture, we have also designed and implemented it, prototyping with Xilinx FPGAs running at 33 MHz.", "paper_title": "A systolic FPGA architecture of two-level dynamic programming for connected speech recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000244546400022"}
