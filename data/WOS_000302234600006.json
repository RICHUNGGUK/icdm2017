It is known that interference is considered as a relationship between link and node in previous works. In this paper, we attempt to capture the physical situation of space-division multiplex more realistically by defining interference as a relationship between any two bidirectional links. We formulate the pair-wise interference condition between any two bidirectional links, and demonstrate that the interference condition is equivalent by employing the equal-power allocation strategy and by employing the minimum-power allocation strategy. Then we further study the typical interference relationship between a link and its surrounding links. To characterize the extent of the interference between a link and its surrounding links, a new metric, the interference coefficient, is given, and its property is explored in detail by means of analysis and simulation. Based on the insight obtained, a centralized algorithm, BIMA, and a distributed algorithm, LIMA, are proposed to control the network interference. Our simulation indicates that BIMA can minimize the network interference while conserving energy and maintaining good spanner property, and LIMA has relatively good interference performance while keeping low node degree, compared with some well-known algorithms. Besides, both BIMA and LIMA show good robustness to additive noises in terms of interference performance.
