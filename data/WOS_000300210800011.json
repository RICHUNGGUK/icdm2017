The model categorizes the factors that influence the result of knowledge transfer during ERR implementation into three types: those implemented by the firm, those implemented by the consultant, and those related to the impact of the knowledge transfer climate. The bonding factors from the two former aspects facilitate the building of a better knowledge transfer climate. A total of 174 respondents are surveyed with results subjected to multivariate analysis. The significance of bonding factors is verified, and the role that the knowledge transfer climate plays in the knowledge transfer process and the impact on the transfer process are developed. This paper provides a broader, richer model of knowledge transfer networks to promote insight into successful ERP implementation. In practice, the key to effective knowledge transfer is the establishment of a positive knowledge transfer climate. To achieve a successful ERR implementation, practitioners should focus on developing a positive relationship with ERR implementation partners. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
