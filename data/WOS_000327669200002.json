The architecture uses two current conveyors (CCs), two grounded capacitors and two grounded resistors; and can realize all standard second-order filter functions - highpass, bandpass, lowpass, notch and allpass. Moreover, the circuit still offers the following advantage features: very low active and passive sensitivities, using of grounded capacitors and resistors which is ideal for integrated circuit implementation, without requirements for critical component matching conditions and very high output impedance. The workability of the proposed circuit has been verified via HSPICE simulations using TSMC 0.18 mu m, level 49 MOSFET technology.", "paper_title": "THREE-INPUTS-ONE-OUTPUT CURRENT-MODE UNIVERSAL BIQUAD USING TWO CURRENT CONVEYORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327669200002"}
