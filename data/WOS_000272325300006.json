Our approach is based on prominent feature extraction and core approximation and segments the mesh into perceptually meaningful components. Based upon the aforementioned premise, we present a methodology to compute the prominent features of the mesh, to approximate the core of the mesh and finally to trace the partitioning boundaries which will be further refined using a minimum cut algorithm. Although the proposed methodology is aligned with a general framework introduced by Lin et al. (IEEE Trans. Multimedia 9(1):46-57, 2007), new approaches have been introduced for the implementation of distinct stages of the framework leading to improved efficiency and robustness. The evaluation of the proposed algorithm is addressed in a consistent framework wherein a comparison with the state of the art is performed.", "paper_title": "Protrusion-oriented 3D mesh segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000272325300006"}
