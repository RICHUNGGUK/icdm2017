This paper presents a new nonparametric linear discriminant analysis method named Push-Pull marginal discriminant analysis (PPMDA), which takes full advantage of marginal information. For two-class cases, the idea of this method is to determine projected directions such that the marginal samples of one class are pushed away from the between-class marginal samples as far as possible and simultaneously pulled to the within-class samples as close as possible. This idea can be extended for multi-class cases and give rise to the PPMDA algorithm for feature extraction of multi-class problems. The proposed method is evaluated using the CENPARMI handwritten numeral database, the Extended Yale face database B and the ORL database. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its advantage after performance over the state-of-the-art feature extraction methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
