Each web page i carries a weight w (i) representative of the frequency with which it is visited. By adding hotlinks, shortcuts from a node to one of its descendants, we are interested in minimizing the expected number of steps needed to visit pages from the home page. We give the first linear time algorithm for assigning hotlinks so that the number of steps to access a page i from the root of the tree reaches the entropy bound, i.e. is at most O(log(W/w (i) )) where W=Sigma(i is an element of T)w(i) . The best previously known algorithm for this task runs in time O(n(2)). We also give the first efficient data structure for maintaining hotlinks when nodes are added, deleted or their weights modified, in amortized time O(log(W/w(i))) per update. The data structure can be made adaptive, i.e. reaches the entropy bound in the amortized sense without knowing the weights w(i) in advance.", "paper_title": "Dynamic hotlinks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252190700003"}
