Efficient utilization of the latest generation of processor architectures requires algorithms that can be both vectorized and parallelized. The approach adopted for vectorization involves combining the layer and neighbor-list methods, while parallelization employs spatial subdivision with explicit communication. The techniques presented here have been used in performance tests on the Cray X1 vector-parallel supercomputer with systems containing over 12 billion atoms. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
