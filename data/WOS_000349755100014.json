The polymers were characterized by two internal coordinates: the number of monomer units and branching bonds. Three commonly used mechanisms for depolymerization (random chain, end chain, and random debranching scission) were applied and formulated such that only physically possible polymers were created. The mechanisms and the population balance equation were formulated in a mixed continuous-discrete manner. The population balance equation was solved using the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM). With this algorithm, the time evolution of the distribution with respect to the internal coordinate was computed. In addition, the algorithm was validated through comparison with Monte Carlo simulations. Notably, the accuracy of the mixed continuous-discrete formulation was significantly higher that of the continuous formulation. However, DQMOM was found to be unsuitable for describing the temporal evolution of the distribution for random scission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
