Researches and applications such as business process modeling, workflow interoperability, web service and ambient intelligence have been involved in this area. However, a holistic understanding is missing. To clarify the requirements and build a research foundation for business process collaboration, a conceptual model is provided in this paper. Then the state of the art and the future trend of business process modeling and process interoperability are reviewed based on this model. Furthermore, inspired by the novel semantic web technologies, a semantic agent based framework to facilitate business process collaboration is given.", "paper_title": "Business process collaboration using semantic interoperability: Review and framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800020"}
