In centralized economic-based allocation approaches, the user requests can be matched to the fastest, cheapest or most available resource. This approach, however, shows limitations in scalability and in dynamic environments. In this paper, we explore a decentralized economic approach for resource allocation in Grid markets based on the Catallaxy paradigm. Catallactic agents discover selling nodes in the resource and service Grid markets, and negotiate with each other maximizing their utility by following a strategy. By means of simulations, we evaluate the behavior of the approach, its resource allocation efficiency and its performance with different demand loads in a number of Grid density and dynamic environments. Our results indicate that while the decentralized economic approach based on Catallaxy applied to Grid markets shows similar efficiency to a centralized system, its decentralized operation provides greater advantages: scalability to demand and offer, and robustness in dynamic environments.", "paper_title": "The catallaxy approach for decentralized economic-based allocation in Grid resource and service markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239295200002"}
