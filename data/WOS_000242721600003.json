In intelligent data mining research, accessing the quality and usefulness of the results from different mining methods is essential. However, there is no general benchmarking criteria to evaluate whether these new methods are indeed more effective compared to the traditional methods. Here we propose a novel benchmarking criteria that can systematically evaluate the effectiveness of any sequential pattern mining method under a variety of situations. The benchmark evaluates how well a mining method finds known common patterns in synthetic data. Such an evaluation provides a comprehensive understanding of the resulting patterns generated from any mining method empirically. In this paper, the criteria are applied to conduct a detailed comparison study of the support-based sequential pattern model with an approximate pattern model based on sequence alignment. The study suggests that the alignment model will give a good summary of the sequential data in the form of a set of common patterns in the data. In contrast, the support model generates massive amounts of frequent patterns with much redundancy. This suggests that the results of the support model require more post processing before it can be of actual use in real applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
