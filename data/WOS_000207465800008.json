This is referred to as the collision problem. To overcome this problem, a novel electronic tag readout method, termed the response probability control method (RPCM), is proposed in this paper. In the RPCM, the reader indicates the response probability of a request, ensuring rapid and simultaneous readout of multiple electronic tags. We have already reported the basic RPCM characteristics for a large number of nonmoving electronic tags. In this paper, the extended characteristics of electronic tags located on a conveyor belt are simulated and a portion of them is analyzed. The RPCM and the existing dynamic framed slotted ALOHA (DFSA) method are compared. The simulation demonstrated that, in the case of nonmoving electronic tags, the readout of the RPCM is 1.6 times faster than that of DFSA, while in the case of moving electronic tags, it is more than 2.5 times faster.", "paper_title": "High-Speed Collective Readout of Large Quantities of Moving Electronic Tags Using the Response Probability Control Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000207465800008"}
