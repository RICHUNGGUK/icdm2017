The basis of this method is on features like color, texture and shape. Color image histograms are very useful tools for this purpose. As these kinds of histograms results with large variations between neighboring bins, they seem so sensitive to any kind of changes such as noise, illumination, etc. To overcome this problem, fuzzy linking histogram based on OWA aggregation operator is proposed, which is capable of projecting 3-dimensional (L*a*b*) color histograms into single-dimension. The proposed method have been evaluated and compared with five other methods in retrieving similar images from the common database. The experimental results, reveals better performance of the proposed method in comparison with the other mentioned methods.", "paper_title": "Content-based image retrieval using OWA fuzzy linking histogram", "paper_id": "WOS:000314772300012"}
