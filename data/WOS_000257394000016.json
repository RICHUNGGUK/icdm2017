It is noted that three parameters, which are dimensionless group velocity, normalized frequency, and grating strength, influence formed solitons by emulation. The novel designs of parallel and serial multi-grating are advanced, and the compound solitons formed from parallel multi-grating are linear superposition; the compound solitons formed from serial multi-grating are nonlinear superposition, and finally two general formulae are obtained. Furthermore, it is theoretically shown that the compound grating solitons are prominent and flexible signals in optical communication.", "paper_title": "Compound solitons in fiber Bragg grating", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000016"}
