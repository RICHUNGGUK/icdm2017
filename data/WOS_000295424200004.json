The model is general in the sense that it can capture both fisheye and conventional as well as catadioptric cameras in a unified framework. The camera model includes efficient handling of non-central cameras as well as compensations for decentring distortion. A novel way of analysing radial distortion functions of camera models leads to a straightforward improvement of conventional models with respect to generality, accuracy and simplicity. Different camera models are experimentally compared for two cameras with conventional and fisheye lenses, and the results show that the overall performance is favourable for the GCM.
