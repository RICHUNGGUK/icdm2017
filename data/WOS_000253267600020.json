We establish an existence theorem of solutions for the generalized strong vector quasi-equilibrium problem by using Kakutani-Fan-Glicksberg fixed point theorem and discuss the closedness of the strong solution set. Moreover, we also derive a stability result for this problem. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
