Existing work so far focuses mainly on recognizing activities of a single user in a home environment. However, there are typically multiple inhabitants in a real home and they often perform activities together. In this paper, we investigate the problem of recognizing multi-user activities using wearable sensors in a home setting. We develop a multi-modal, wearable sensor platform to collect sensor data for multiple users, and study two temporal probabilistic models-Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) and Factorial Conditional Random Field (FCRF)-to model interacting processes in a sensor-based, multi-user scenario. We conduct a real-world trace collection done by two subjects over two weeks, and evaluate these two models through our experimental studies. Our experimental results show that we achieve an accuracy of 96.41% with CHMM and an accuracy of 87.93% with FCRF, respectively, for recognizing multi-user activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
