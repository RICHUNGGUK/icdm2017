In [21], a conjecture on the structure of the trees with minimal ABC index, based on the assumption of existence of a central vertex, was posed. This conjecture was partially disproved in [1,2], and subsequently in [12], which led to its modification. Here, we show that for sufficiently large trees, also the modified version of the conjecture fails in all of its cases. Presented counterexamples and their analysis suggest new conjectures.", "paper_title": "Disproving a Conjecture on Trees with Minimal Atom-Bond Connectivity Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000346106900007"}
