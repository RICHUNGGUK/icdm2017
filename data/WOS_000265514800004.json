We compare existing offline excess bandwidth distribution with conventional limited interleaved polling with adaptive cycle time (IPACT-limited) in terms of packet delay performance. We identify the factors that result in packet delay reduction with excess bandwidth distribution compared to IPACT-limited and discover that existing offline excess distribution mechanisms become unstable at moderate to high loads in long-range EPONs with large round-trip propagation delays. We propose a novel online excess bandwidth distribution (OEBD) mechanism to provide stable excess bandwidth distribution even at high loads in long-range EPONs. We demonstrate how OEBD can be tuned via parameters to provide grant sizing between limited and gated service.
