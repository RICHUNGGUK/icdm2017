In particular, while the requirements for attitude and orbit control systems are becoming more and more stringent, there is also a need for adequate design tools in order to cope efficiently with tightening budgets for space missions. In this paper, the main issues related to the modelling and simulation of satellite dynamics are introduced and discussed, and the results obtained so far in developing a spacecraft simulation library based on the Modelica language are presented.", "paper_title": "Control-oriented modelling and simulation of spacecraft attitude and orbit dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000234717700006"}
