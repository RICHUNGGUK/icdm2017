This problem is NP-hard, and we provide a polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem. Our method is based on Lagrangian relaxation mixed with carefully guessing the positions of certain jobs in the schedule.", "paper_title": "The constrained minimum weighted sum of job completion times problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000237563700006"}
