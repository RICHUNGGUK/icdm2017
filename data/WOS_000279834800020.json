Traditionally, the neurons in a SUM are represented by vectors, but in this paper we propose to use GMMs instead. To this end, we introduce a method to adapt a GMM such that its distance to a second GMM decreases at a controllable rate. Self organization is demonstrated using a small music database and a music classification task. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
