The architecture is based on the adaptive highest random weight (adaptive HRW) algorithm proposed to design load-balanced Internet routers. Extensive numerical evaluation of static and adaptive variations of the routing architecture is studied, and their effect on the network performance in terms of packet drop and flow remapping is presented. The architecture can be seen as a combination of adaptive core node scheduling and adaptive load balancing at the edge nodes. It is stateless and can compute routes quickly based on the packet flow identifier.", "paper_title": "Flow-based load-balancing architecture for the agile all-photonic network", "paper_id": "WOS:000305533300001"}
