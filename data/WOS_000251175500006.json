The proposed method first approximates the contour of a planar shape with an equilateral polygon and then makes a representation using the polygon's interior angle chain. The difference between two shapes is measured by the distance between their IAC's. An algorithm to obtain equilateral polygon approximation and its associated IAC is proposed in this paper. The proposed shape representation scheme has been tested on two benchmarks and applied to lake recognition in SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. The results show that IAC is an effective shape representation scheme.", "paper_title": "An invariant shape representation: Interior angle chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175500006"}
