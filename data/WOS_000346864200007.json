We propose an OFDMA-based PON with a transmission employing intensity modulation/direct detection in the downstream and a remodulation of a remotely seeded carrier provided by the optical line terminal with coherent detection in the upstream, which enables cost-effective colorless optical network units (ONUs). Furthermore, an OFDMA-PON field trial using the proposed scheme over 37.5 km feeder fiber is demonstrated. A power budget supporting 32 ONUs with dynamic bandwidth allocation and trellis coded modulation (TCM) is reported.", "paper_title": "37.5 km Urban Field Trial of OFDMA-PON Using Colorless ONUs With Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation and TCM", "paper_id": "WOS:000346864200007"}
