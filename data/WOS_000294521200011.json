However, in some scenarios access to real-time streams of monitoring information, rather than persistent data sets, would be beneficial. In this paper, we evaluate the Complex Event Processing (CEP) approach applied to real-time Grid monitoring and argue that CEP enables us to achieve two goals, otherwise difficult to combine: real-time access to monitoring data and advanced query capabilities. Monitoring for the purpose of dynamic allocation of Grid resources serves as a case study to demonstrate powerful real-time query capabilities provided by CEP. In addition, we show how to employ CEP for data reduction. For practical verification of our solution, a CEP-based Grid monitoring infrastructure, GEMINI2, has been developed. We have measured the overhead due to CEP-based monitoring and conclude that real-time Grid monitoring is possible without excessive intrusiveness for resources and network. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
