Examples are curvature or normal vectors. The accurate computation of this information directly from the finite element mesh often requires a high degree of refinementwhich is not necessarily required to obtain an accurate flow solution. As a remedy and an option to be able to use coarser meshes, the representation of the free surface using non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) curves or surfaces is investigated in this work. The advantages of a NURBS parameterization in comparison with the standard approach are discussed. In addition, it is explored how the pressure jump resulting from surface tension effects can be handled using doubled interface nodes. Numerical examples include the computation of surface tension in a two-phase flow as well as the computation of normal vectors as a basis for mesh deformation methods. For these examples, the improvement of the numerical solution compared with the standard approaches on identical meshes is shown.
