Researchers have previously revealed that the existing marking mechanism causes the unfairness in aggregates. This study presents a new marking algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the fairness of the proposed scheme exceeds that of SRTCM, TRTCM, TSWTCM and ITSWTCM for medium to high network provision levels.", "paper_title": "Improving fairness in DiffServ networks using adaptive aggregate markers", "paper_id": "WOS:000247892300015"}
