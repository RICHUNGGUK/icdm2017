The models are developed for both risk neutral and risk-averse decision-makers and can be applicable for different types of disruptions related among others to the supply of raw materials, the production process, and the distribution system, as well as security breaches and natural disasters. Analytical closed-form solutions are obtained and interesting managerial insights on the merit of contingency strategies in managing uncertainties and risks in dual-sourcing supply chains are discussed.
