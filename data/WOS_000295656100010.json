Moreover, the network architecture in LTE-Advanced system is modified to take into account coordinated transmission. In our study, we explore the problem of jointly optimizing the power level and scheduling of resource blocks for LIE-Advanced network based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We propose a distributed optimization scheme based on evolutionary potential games, and in the process of objective function modeling we employ the Lagrangian multiplier method to solve the constraint objective optimization problem. Then particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is adopted to find the optimal power allocation and scheduling for each resource block in the multi-cell framework. Numerical results prove that proposed algorithm notably improves the overall throughput, while user fairness is guaranteed. Importantly, additional computation and communication cost introduced by cross-layer optimization is also evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
