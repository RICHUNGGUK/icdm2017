In each step of the iteration, we trace a direction completely different from primal simplex method, dual simplex method, primal-dual method and interior point method. The new method is impervious to primal degeneracy and can reach a pair of exact primal and dual optimal solutions without purifying process. Numerical results are presented that support our theoretical results and confirm the viability of the approach.", "paper_title": "Dual-primal algorithm for linear optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000311777600006"}
