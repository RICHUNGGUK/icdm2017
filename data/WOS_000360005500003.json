The concept was originally developed for sharing computing resources remotely. It has been receiving increasing attention from researchers in both academia and industry in recent years due to the proliferation of cloud computing and mobile devices. In this article, we survey the interactive remote rendering systems proposed in the literature, analyze how to improve the state of the art, and summarize the related technologies. The readers of this article will understand the history of remote rendering systems and obtain some inspirations of the future research directions in this area.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Interactive Remote Rendering Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005500003"}
