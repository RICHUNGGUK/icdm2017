The Szeged and edge Szeged indices are defined, respectively, as Sz(G) = Sigma(uv is an element of E(G)) n(u)(e, G) . n(v) (e, G) and Sz(e)(G) = Sigma(uv is an element of E(G)) m(u)(e, G) . m(v)(e, G). In this paper, we provide a unified approach to characterize the tree with the minimum and maximum GA(2), GA(3), Sz and Sz(e) indices among the set of trees with given order and pendent vertices, respectively. As applications, we deduce a result of [2] concerning tree with the maximum GA(2) index and a result of [3] concerning tree with the maximum GA(3) index.", "paper_title": "A Unified Approach to Extremal Trees with Respect to Geometric-Arithmetic, Szeged and Edge Szeged Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000290503400008"}
