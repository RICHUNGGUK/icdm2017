Particle filter is one of the promising methods, but it is difficult to apply to real-time objects tracking because of its high computation cost. In order to reduce the processing cost without sacrificing the tracking quality, this paper proposes a new method for real-time 3D objects tracking, using parallelized particle filter algorithms by MapReduce architecture which is running on GPGPU. Our methods are as follows. First, we use a Kinect to get the 3D information of objects. Unlike the conventional 2D-based objects tracking, 3D objects tracking adds depth information. It can track not only from the x and y axis but also from the z axis, and the depth information can correct some errors in 2D objects tracking. Second, to solve the high computation cost problem, we use the MapReduce architecture on GPGPU to parallelize the particle filter algorithm. We implement the particle filter algorithms on GPU and evaluate the performance by actually running a program on CUDA5.5.", "paper_title": "3D Objects Tracking by MapReduce GPGPU-Enhanced Particle Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000356590300005"}
