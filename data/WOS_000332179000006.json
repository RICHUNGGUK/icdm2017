Two main mechanisms for the unimolecular decomposition of BTTN were found. In the first, homolysis of one of the O-NO2 bonds occurs to form center dot NO2 and CH2ONO2CHONO2CH2CH2O center dot, which subsequently decomposes to form CH3CHO + center dot CHO + 3NO(2) + HCHO. In the second, successive HONO elimination reactions yield three HONO and OHCCH2CHONO2CH2ONO2 fragments, which subsequently decompose to form CH3CHO + 2CO + 3HONO. We also found that the first pathway has a slightly lower activation energy than the second. The results show that the pathway involving O-NO2 cleavage is slightly more energetically favorable than that involving HONO elimination.", "paper_title": "A DFT study of the unimolecular decomposition of 1,2,4-butanetriol trinitrate", "paper_id": "WOS:000332179000006"}
