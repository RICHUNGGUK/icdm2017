It is based on the radix-2 non-restoring division algorithm. Fast computation is achieved by the use of the radix-2 signed-digit (SD2) representation. The algorithm does not require normalization of the divisor, and hence, does not require an area-consuming leading-one (or zero) detection nor shifts of variable-amount. Combinational (unfolded) implementation of the algorithm yields a regularly structured array divider, and sequential implementation yields compact dividers.", "paper_title": "A hardware algorithm for integer division using the SD2 representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800056"}
