With the advent of multi-core computers, there is a renewed interest in programming models that can support a wide range of parallel programming patterns. The proposed unified model shows how the divide-and-conquer approach of the AFM and the no-shared mutable state and event-driven philosophy of the AM can be combined to solve certain classes of problems more efficiently and productively than either of the aforementioned models individually. The unified model adds actor creation and coordination to the AFM, while also enabling parallelization within actors. This paper describes two implementations of the unified model as extensions of Habanero-Java and Habanero-Scala. The unified model adds to the foundations of parallel programs, and to the tools available for the programmer to aid in productivity and performance while developing parallel software.", "paper_title": "Integrating Task Parallelism with Actors", "paper_id": "WOS:000311296200044"}
