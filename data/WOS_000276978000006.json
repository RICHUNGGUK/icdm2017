Let Z(a)(t), t is an element of [0, 2a], be a zero-mean Gaussian stationary a.s. continuous process with a covariance function of the form EZ(a)(t)Z(a)(s) = 1/2[a - vertical bar t - s vertical bar], t, s is an element of [0, 2a]. For 0 < p < infinity, we prove results on sharp asymptotics as epsilon -> 0 of the probabilities P{integral(T)(0) vertical bar eta(a)(t)vertical bar(p) dt <= epsilon(p)} for T <= a, P{integral(T)(0)vertical bar Z(a)(t)vertical bar(p) dt <= epsilon(p)} for T < 2a, and compute similar asymptotics for the sup- norm. Derivation of the results is based on the method of comparing with a Wiener process. We present numerical values of the asymptotics in the case p = 1, p = 2, and for the sup- norm. We also consider application of the obtained results to one functional quantization problem of information theory.", "paper_title": "Small Deviations for Two Classes of Gaussian Stationary Processes and L-p-Functionals, 0 < p <= infinity", "paper_id": "WOS:000276978000006"}
