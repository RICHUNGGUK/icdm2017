Mobility in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is one of the most important WSN technologies for applications such as healthcare, vehicular communication systems, intelligent transport systems, and logistics applications. This paper proposes a new mobility management architecture for WSNs that is based on the ID/LOC separation concept for ID-based communications with location-based routing. The proposed architecture supports energy-efficient lightweight mobility control for a large number of WSNs by distributed management manner. Furthermore, the discover-before-forward concept is proposed for route optimization. Performance results show that the proposed ID/LOC separation-based mobility architecture for supporting 6LoWPAN is more efficient and lighter than the existing HIP scheme in terms of energy consumption, total signaling cost and packet delivery cost ratio.", "paper_title": "An ID/Locator Separation-Based Mobility Management Architecture for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342162600006"}
