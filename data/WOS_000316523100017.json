Participating respondents were considered exemplary as they each won the Milken Educator Award during the 1996-2009 computer era. Overall perceptions are reported along with trend, differences in perceptions by subject area taught, and differences in perception by Primary and Secondary teacher population categories. Overall game usage is reported along with association of perceptions with game usage as well as usage differences due to grade category. Among other findings, adoption of computer-based games for educational use in the classroom by exemplar Primary teacher populations appeared to be in the Late Majority stage of the Rogers Technology Adoption Curve while adoption in the classroom by exemplar Secondary teacher populations appeared to be in the beginning of the Early Majority stage.
