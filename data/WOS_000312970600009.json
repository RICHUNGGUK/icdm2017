The knowledge-acquisition workshops that responded to this interest led to the formation of a vibrant research community that has achieved remarkable consensus on a number of issues. These viewpoints include (1) the rejection of the notion of knowledge as a commodity to be transferred from one locus to another, (2) an acceptance of the situated nature of human expertise, (3) emphasis on knowledge acquisition as the modeling of problem solving, and (4) the pursuit of reusable patterns in problem solving and in domain descriptions that can facilitate both modeling and system implementation. The Semantic Web community will benefit greatly by incorporating these perspectives in its work. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
