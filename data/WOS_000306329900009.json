One primary goal of such experiments is to detect genes with the temporal changes over a period of time or at some interested time points. Difficulties arising from data with small number of replicates over only a few unaligned time points in multiple groups pose challenges for efficient statistical analysis. Some known methods are limited by the unverifiable assumptions or by the scope of applications for only two groups. We present a new method for detecting differentially expressed genes under nonhomogeneous time course experiments in multiple groups. The new method first models the time course curve of one gene by a Gaussian process to align the nonhomogeneous time course data and to compute the gradient of the time course curve as well, the latter of which is used as directional information to enhance the sensitivity of detection for temporal changes. Second, we adopt a nonparametric method to test a surrogate hypothesis based on the augmented data from the Gaussian process model. The proposed method is robust in terms of model fitting and testing. It does not require any distributional assumption for the observations or the test statistic and the method works for the case with as few as triplicate samples over four or five time points under multiple groups. We show the effectiveness and superiority of the new method in comparison with some existing methods using simulated models and two real data sets.", "paper_title": "A NEW METHOD FOR NONHOMOGENEOUS TIME COURSE EXPRESSION ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306329900009"}
