Due to limited energy resource of sensors, each of them should minimize the energy consumption to prolong the network lifetime. In this paper, a distributed algorithm for the multi-hop wireless sensor network is proposed to construct a novel energy efficient tree topology, without having location information of the nodes. Energy conservation of the nodes is accomplished by controlling transmission power of the nodes. Besides, maintenance of the network topology due to energy scarcity of the gateway nodes is also proposed in the protocol. Simulation results show that our distributed protocol can achieve energy conservation up to an optimum level similar to the centralized algorithm that we have considered and can extend the network lifetime as compared to other distributed algorithms without any power control.
