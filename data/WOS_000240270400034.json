A rule-based approach was selected due to its high adaptability, low memory and computational capacity requirements. The speech synthesis system is written in Java (TM) MIDP 2.0 and CLDC 1.1. The synthesis is implemented on Nokia 6680 mobile device as a 65 kilobyte MIDlet. The system produces artificial speech at the sampling rate of 16 kHz. The results show that for a second of synthesized speech it takes 2.66 seconds for the system to produce it. Although the implementation was successful, improvements are needed to achieve a more acceptable level of time consumption.", "paper_title": "Implementing a rule-based speech synthesizer on a mobile platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400034"}
