We detect Space Time Interest Points (STIP) and generate their description based on the facet model. The proposed approach detects interest points in video data using the three-dimensional facet model efficiently. Then we describe each interest point by three-dimensional Haar wavelet transform and time derivatives of different order obtained from said facet model. Here we represent each video clip following the bag-of-words approach by learning feature specific dictionary. Finally, classification is done using non-linear SVM with chi(2)-kernel. We evaluate the performance of our system on standard datasets like Weizmann, KTH, UCF sports, ICD, UCF YouTube, and UCF50 and get better, or at least comparable results compared to other state-of-the-art systems.", "paper_title": "Space-Time Facet Model for Human Activity Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720200003"}
