An analytical methodology for thermal-aware repeater insertion that includes the electrothermal coupling between power, delay, and temperature is presented, and simulation results with global interconnect repeaters are discussed for 90- and 65-nm technology. Simulation results show that the proposed thermal-aware methodology can save 17.5% more power consumed by the repeaters compared to a thermal-unaware methodology for a given allowed delay penalty. In addition, the proposed methodology also results in a lower chip temperature, and thus, extra leakage power savings from other logic blocks.", "paper_title": "Thermal-aware methodology for repeater insertion in low-power VLSI circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314500013"}
