On the other hand, such components should support security applications such as message integrity, authentication, and time stamping. The latter are efficiently implemented by Hash Message Authentication Codes (HMAC). As clearly stated in the literature, current approved implementations of HMAC require resources that cannot be supported in constrained components. An approach to implement a compact HMAC by the use of stream ciphering is presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Message Authentication in Computationally Constrained Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000266033300008"}
