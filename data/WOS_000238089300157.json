We developed interfaces which supports non-verbal modes of communication. We introduce the Poultry.Internet system, a remote multi-modal human-pet interaction system. This system allows humans to remotely touch their pet using a system interconnected through the Internet. We also present the Internet. Pajama, a wearable suit which allows parents to interact with their child. The aim of the system is to allow parents to hug their child while they are not at home.", "paper_title": "Poultry.Internet and Internet Pajama: Novel systems for remote haptic interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300157"}
