With Ethane we propose a hybrid parallel search algorithm inspired in the structure of the chemical compound of the same name, implementing a heterogeneous island model based in the structure of the chemical bonds of the ethane compound. Here we also shape a schema for describing a complete family of parallel heterogeneous metaheuristics inspired by the structure of hydrocarbons in nature, HydroCM (HydroCarbon inspired Metaheuristics), establishing a resemblance between atoms and computers, and between chemical bonds and communication links. Our goal is to gracefully match computers of different computing power to algorithms of different behavior (genetic algorithm and simulated annealing in this study), all them collaborating to solve the same problem. In addition to the nice natural metaphor we will show that Ethane, though simple, can solve search problems in a faster and more robust way than well-known panmictic and distributed algorithms very popular in the literature, as well as can achieve a better exploration/exploitation balance during the search process.", "paper_title": "Dealing with hardware heterogeneity: a new parallel search model", "paper_id": "WOS:000319433600005"}
