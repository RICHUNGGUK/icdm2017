Pure risk measures (risk deviation measures) are natural generalizations of the standard deviation. While pure risk measures are typically convex, acceptability measures are typically concave. In both cases, the convexity (concavity) implies under mild conditions the existence of subgradients (supergradients). The present paper investigates the relation between the subgradient (supergradient) representation and the properties of the corresponding risk measures. In particular, we show how monotonicity properties are reflected by the subgradient representation. Once the subgradient (supergradient) representation has been established, it is extremely easy to derive these monotonicity properties. We give a list of Examples.", "paper_title": "Subdifferential representations of risk measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000238743300007"}
