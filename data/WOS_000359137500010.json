Although showing huge benefits, MWNs face many security problems, particularly the internal multi-layer security threats being one of the most challenging issues. Since most security mechanisms require the cooperation of nodes, characterizing and learning actions of neighboring nodes and the evolution of these actions over time is vital to constructing an efficient and robust solution for security-sensitive applications such as social networking, mobile banking and teleconferencing. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic Cross-layer Reputation computation Model (CRM) to dynamically characterize and quantify actions of nodes. CRM couples an uncertainty-based conventional layered reputation computation model (RCM) with cross-layer design and multi-level security technology to identify malicious nodes and preservation of security against internal multi-layer threats. Simulation results and performance analyses demonstrate that CRM can provide rapid and accurate malicious node identification and management, and implement the preservation of security against the internal multi-layer and bad-mouthing attacks more effectively and efficiently than existing models.", "paper_title": "CRM: A New Dynamic Cross-Layer Reputation Computation Model in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000359137500010"}
