The vendor offers a single product to the buyer and the lead time can be controllable with adding crashing cost. Two supply chain inventory models with controllable lead time under different decision modes are considered, one is proposed under decentralized model based on Stackelberg model, the other is proposed under centralized model of the integrated supply chain. The solution procedures are also suggested to get the optimal solutions of these two models. In addition, an asymmetric Nash bargaining model based on satisfaction level is also developed to get the best cost allocation ratio between the vendor and the buyer by taking their individual rationalities into consideration. The results of numerical example show that shortening lead time reasonably can reduce inventory cost and the cost allocation model based on satisfaction level developed in this paper is effective.
