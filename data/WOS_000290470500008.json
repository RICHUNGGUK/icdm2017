In this work, we have identified and categorised different approaches to the management of SDK generally having instrumental and technical subject matter. To complement the current literature in this field of study, our approach to the management of SDK has taken into account the system developer's cognitive processing concerns. As such, we have proposed and successfully tested a strategic method for SDK management in a real working situation. In this empirical study, the implementation of an artificial knowledge structure has been shown to be useful as a means of decreasing the system developer's cognitive processing load as regards SDK. The first of two implications is such that cognitive consideration in relation to SDK management has further developmental potential. The second implication is that the system development environment can provide cognitive support to the system developer.", "paper_title": "Management of system development knowledge: a cognitive approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000290470500008"}
