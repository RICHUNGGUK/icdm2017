In [24], it is shown that due to the loss of regularity in link topology, generating Hamiltonian cycles, even in a healthy crossed cube, is a more complicated procedure than in the hypercube, and fewer Hamiltonian cycles can be generated in the crossed cube. Because of the importance of fault-tolerance in interconnection networks, in this paper, we treat the problem of embedding Hamiltonian cycles into a crossed cube with failed links. We establish a relationship between the faulty link distribution and the crossed cube's tolerability. A succinct algorithm is proposed to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a CQ(n) tolerating up to n - 2 failed links.", "paper_title": "Hamiltonian Embedding in Crossed Cubes with Failed Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000308998100011"}
