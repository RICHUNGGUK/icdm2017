By introducing the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC), the present implementation can determine the change of the tangential momentum on the wall and then impose the correct boundary conditions for LBM. The simulation results demonstrate that this implementation is equivalent to the first-order slip model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
