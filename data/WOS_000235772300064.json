CGVF improves on classical GVF by simplifying the formulas and increasing the item of curvature, so that the edge information can be kept well and diffused more quickly. Several standard images are used to segmenting experiments, and the results show that CGVF has obvious advantages compared with GVF in the iteration number of force field, the evolvement number of curve and the accuracy of convergence. In particular, when the initial curve is far from the edge of object, the convergence will be more superior.", "paper_title": "A new active contour model: Curvature gradient vector flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300064"}
