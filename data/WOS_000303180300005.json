We generalize these constructions to mixed systems, whose Newton polytopes are scaled copies of one polytope, thus taking a step towards systems with arbitrary supports. First, we specify matrices whose determinant equals the resultant and characterize the systems that admit such formulae. Bezout-type determinantal formulae do not exist, but we describe all possible Sylvester-type and hybrid formulae. We establish tight bounds for all corresponding degree vectors, and specify domains that will surely contain such vectors; the latter are new even for the unmixed case. Second, we make use of multiplication tables and strong duality theory to specify resultant matrices explicitly, for a general scaled system, thus including unmixed systems. The encountered matrices are classified; these include a new type of Sylvester-type matrix as well as Bezout-type matrices, known as partial Bezoutians. Our public-domain MAPLE implementation includes efficient storage of complexes in memory, and construction of resultant matrices. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
