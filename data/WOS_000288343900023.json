Selection of the best energy technology requires the consideration of conflicting quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria. When decision-makers' judgments are under uncertainty, it is relatively difficult for them to provide exact numerical values. The fuzzy set theory is a strong tool which can deal with the uncertainty in case of subjective, incomplete, and vague information. It is easier for an energy planning expert to make an evaluation by using linguistic terms. In this paper, a modified fuzzy TOPSIS methodology is proposed for the selection of the best energy technology alternative. TOPSIS is a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) technique which determines the best alternative by calculating the distances from the positive and negative ideal solutions according to the evaluation scores of the experts. In the proposed methodology, the weights of the selection criteria are determined by fuzzy pairwise comparison matrices. The methodology is applied to an energy planning decision-making problem.
