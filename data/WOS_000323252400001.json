While translations from statecharts to Petri nets exist, a well-defined translation from Petri nets to statecharts is lacking. Such a translation should map an input net to a corresponding statechart, having a structure and behaviour similar to that of the input net. Since statecharts can only model a restricted form of concurrency, not every Petri net has a corresponding statechart. We identify a class of Petri nets, called statechartable nets, that can be translated to corresponding statecharts. Statechartable Petri nets are structurally defined using the novel notion of an area. We also define a structural translation that maps each statechartable Petri net to a corresponding statechart. The translation is proven sound and complete for statechartable Petri nets.", "paper_title": "Statechartable Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000323252400001"}
