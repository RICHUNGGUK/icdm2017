Most of those techniques, however, do not provide the replica consistency because the data replica is just periodically updated through the remote clients. We have developed two kinds of data replication techniques, called owner-initiated replication and client-initiated replication. Our replication techniques do not need to use file system-level locking functions so that they can easily be ported to any of file systems. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of our two replication techniques and present performance results on Linux clusters.", "paper_title": "Data replication techniques for data-intensive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500141"}
