The specifications of existing service level agreements (SLA) for cloud services are not designed to flexibly handle even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. In this article, we present a novel approach for SLA-based management of cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. We present an end-to-end framework for consumer-centric SLA management of cloud-hosted databases. The framework facilitates adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. In this framework, the SLA of the consumer applications are declaratively defined in terms of goals which are subjected to a number of constraints that are specific to the application requirements. The framework continuously monitors the application-defined SLA and automatically triggers the execution of necessary corrective actions (scaling out/in the database tier) when required. The framework is database platform-agnostic, uses virtualization-based database replication mechanisms, and requires zero source code changes of the cloud-hosted software applications. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLA-based framework in providing the consumer applications with the required flexibility for achieving their SLA requirements.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Consumer-Centric SLA Management of Cloud-Hosted Databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000359231200001"}
