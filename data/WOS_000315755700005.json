Basic properties of the spaces and the associated reproducing kernels are investigated. We also present feature map constructions and several concrete examples of vector-valued RKBSs. The theory is then applied to multi-task machine learning. Especially, the representer theorem and characterization equations for the minimizer of regularized learning schemes in vector-valued RKBSs are established. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
