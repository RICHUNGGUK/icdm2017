They are often created as a mosaic of many smaller images. The mosaic acquisition can take many hours causing the individual images to differ in exposure and lighting conditions. A blending operation is often necessary to give the appearance of a seamless image. The blending quality depends on the magnitude of discontinuity along the image boundaries. Often, new boundaries, or seams, are first computed that minimize this transition. Current techniques based on multi-labeling Graph Cuts are too slow and memory intensive for gigapixel sized panoramas. In this paper, we present a parallel, out-of-core seam computing technique that is fast, has small memory footprint, and is capable of running efficiently on different types of parallel systems. Its maximum memory usage is configurable, in the form of a cache, which can improve performance by reducing redundant disk I/O and computations. It shows near-perfect scaling on symmetric multiprocessing systems and good scaling on clusters and distributed shared memory systems. Our technique improves the time required to compute seams for gigapixel imagery from many hours (or even days) to just a few minutes, while still producing boundaries with energy that is on-par with Graph Cuts.", "paper_title": "Distributed Seams for Gigapixel Panoramas", "paper_id": "WOS:000351755700005"}
