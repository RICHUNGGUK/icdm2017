Fuzzy logic (FL) as a well-known AI technique is effectively used in modeling of machining processes such as to predict the surface roughness and to control the cutting force in various machining processes. This paper is started with the introduction to definition of FL and machining process, and their relation. This paper then presents five types of analysis conducted on FL techniques used in machining process. FL was considered for prediction, selection, monitoring, control and optimization of machining process. Literature showed that milling contributed the highest number of machining operation that was modeled using FL. In terms of machining performance, surface roughness was mostly studied with FL model. In terms of fuzzy components, center of gravity method was mostly used to perform defuzzification, and triangular was mostly considered to perform membership function. The reviews extend the analysis on the abilities, limitations and effectual modifications of FL in modeling based on the comments from previous works that conduct experiment using FL in the modeling and review by few authors. The analysis leads the author to conclude that FL is the most popular AI techniques used in modeling of machining process.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy logic for modeling machining process: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000349597900002"}
