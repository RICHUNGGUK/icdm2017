The fundamental purpose of an associative memory is to recover correct output patterns from input patterns, which can be altered by additive, subtractive or combined noise. The Steinbuch Lernmatrix was the first associative memory developed in 1961, and is used as a pattern recognition classifier. However, a misclassification problem is presented when crossbar saturation occurs. A new algorithm that corrects the misclassification in the Lernmatrix is proposed in this work. The results of crossbar saturation with fundamental patterns demonstrate a better performance of pattern recalling using the new algorithm. Experiments with real data show a more efficient classifier when the algorithm is introduced in the original Lernmatrix. Therefore, the thresholded Lernmatrix memory emerges as a suitable and alternative classifier to be used in the developing pattern processing field.", "paper_title": "New algorithm for efficient pattern recall using a static threshold with the Steinbuch Lernmatrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000290616000002"}
