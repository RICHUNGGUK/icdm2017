They preserve measures of resistance to differential and linear cryptanalysis. For functions over GF(2(n)), affine bundles coincide with EA-equivalence classes. From equivalence classes (\"bundles\") of presemifields of order p n, we derive bundles of functions over GF(p(n)) of the form lambda(x)(*)rho(x), where lambda, rho are linearised permutation polynomials and (*) is a presemifield multiplication. We prove there are exactly p bundles of presemifields of order p(2) and give a representative of each. We compute all bundles of presemifields of orders p(n) <= 27 and in the isotopism class of GF(32) and we measure the differential uniformity of the derived lambda(x)(*)rho(x). This technique produces functions with low differential uniformity, including PN functions (p odd), and quadratic APN and differentially 4-uniform functions (p = 2).", "paper_title": "Bundles, presemifields and nonlinear functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258933600007"}
