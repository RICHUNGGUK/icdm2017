In the standard ASM, local appearances are described by intensity profiles, and the model parameter estimation is based on the assumption that the profiles follow a Gaussian distribution. It suffers from variations of poses, illumination, expressions and obstacles. In this paper, an improved ASM framework, GentleBoost based SIFT-ASM is proposed. Local appearances of landmarks are originally represented by SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) descriptors, which are gradient orientation histograms based representations of image neighborhood. They can provide more robust and accurate guidance for search than grey-level profiles. Moreover, GentleBoost classifiers are applied to model and search the SIFT features instead of the unnecessary assumption of Gaussian distribution. Experimental results show that SIFT-ASM significantly outperforms the original ASM in aligning and localizing facial features.", "paper_title": "Face Alignment Based on Statistical Models Using SIFT Descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700048"}
