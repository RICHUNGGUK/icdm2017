To aid discussion, a fuzzy pre-metric condition is introduced. It is first pointed out that under the fuzzy pre-metric condition the first triangle inequality is always equivalent to its level form. The second triangle inequality is equivalent to one level form when R is right continuous, and to another level form also when further conditions are imposed on R. In a fuzzy metric space, the level form of the first triangle inequality and one of the level forms of the second triangle inequality are always valid. The other level form of the second triangle inequality holds for all but at most countable alpha is an element of [0, 1). Finally, a fixed point theorem for fuzzy metric spaces is derived as an application of the preceding results. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
