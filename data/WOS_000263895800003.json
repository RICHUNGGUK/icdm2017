It is based on multidimensional scaling and Euclidean Steiner trees in high-dimensional spaces. Preliminary computational experience shows that the use of Euclidean Steiner trees for finding phylogenetic trees is a viable approach. Experiments also indicate that the new method is comparable with results produced by neighbor joining (Saitou and Nei, Mol Biol Evol 4 (1987), 406-425). (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
