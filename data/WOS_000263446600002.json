The first one is based on the tetraharmonic equation: we show the existence and uniqueness of the solution of Delta(4)(x) over right arrow = 0 with prescribed boundary and adjacent to the boundary control points of a n x n Bezier surface. The second one is based on the nonhomogeneous biharmonic equation Delta(2)(x) over right arrow = p. where p could be understood as a vectorial load adapted to the C-1-boundary conditions.
