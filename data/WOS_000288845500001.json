On the other hand, this depends on the spatial shape and tertiary structure of protein and folding of its constituent components in space. The correct identification of protein domain fold solely using extracted information from protein sequence is a complicated and controversial task in the current computational biology. In this article a combined classifier based on the information content of extracted features from the primary structure of protein has been introduced to face this challenging problem. In the first stage of our proposed two-tier architecture, there are several classifiers each of which is trained with a different sequence based feature vector. Apart from the application of the predicted secondary structure, hydrophobicity, van der Waals volume, polarity, polarizability, and different dimensions of pseudo-amino acid composition vectors in similar studies, the position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) has also been used to improve the correct classification rate (CCR) in this study. Using K-fold cross validation on training dataset related to 27 famous folds of SCOP, the 28 dimensional probability output vector from each evidence theoretic K-NN classifier is used to determine the information content or expertness of corresponding feature for discrimination in each fold class. In the second stage, the outputs of classifiers for test dataset are fused using Sugeno fuzzy integral operator to make better decision for target fold class. The expertness factor of each classifier in each fold class has been used to calculate the fuzzy integral operator weights. Results make it possible to provide deeper interpretation about the effectiveness of each feature for discrimination in target classes for query proteins. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
