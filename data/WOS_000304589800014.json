Among these methods, genetic algorithms (GAs) have often been used with excellent results. Nevertheless, few attention has been dedicated so far to the generality and robustness of the learned rules. In this paper, we show that when GAs are used to evolve asynchronous one-dimensional CA rules, they are able to find more general and robust solutions compared to the more usual case of evolving synchronous CA rules.", "paper_title": "A study on learning robustness using asynchronous 1D cellular automata rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000304589800014"}
