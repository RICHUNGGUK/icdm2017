With that goal in mind, the authors are developing an inexpensive class of volumetric displays that can present certain types of 3D content, including simple 3D objects, extruded objects, and 3D surfaces that appear dynamic when projected with time-varying images, at relatively low resolution. Their displays use a simple light engine and a cloud of passive optical scatterers. The basic idea is to trade off the light engine's 2D spatial resolution to gain resolution in the third dimension.", "paper_title": "3D display using passive optical scatterers", "paper_id": "WOS:000247913100012"}
