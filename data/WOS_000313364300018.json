In this article, we argue that the preservation of musical works having technological components should be grounded in a thorough documentation of the creative process that accounts for both human and nonhuman agents of creation. The present research aims at providing a ground for documentation policies that account for the creative process and provide relevant information for performance, migration, and analysis. To do so, we analyzed secondary ethnographic data from a two-year creation and production process of a musical work having a focus on gesture following. Using grounded theory, we developed a conceptual framework with different levels of abstraction and consequent levels of transferability to other creative contexts. Finally, we propose several paths for grounding a subsequent documentation framework in this conceptual framework.", "paper_title": "Following Gesture Following: Grounding the Documentation of a Multi-Agent Music Creation Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000313364300018"}
