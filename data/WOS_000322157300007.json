Classification with Bayesian networks aims to compute the class with the highest probability given a case. This special kind is referred to as Bayesian network classifiers. Since learning the Bayesian network structure from a dataset can be viewed as an optimization problem, heuristic search algorithms may be applied to build high-quality networks in medium- or large-scale problems, as exhaustive search is often feasible only for small problems. In this paper, we present our new algorithm, ABC-Miner, and propose several extensions to it. ABC-Miner uses ant colony optimization for learning the structure of Bayesian network classifiers. We report extended computational results comparing the performance of our algorithm with eight other classification algorithms, namely six variations of well-known Bayesian network classifiers, cAnt-Miner for discovering classification rules and a support vector machine algorithm.", "paper_title": "Learning Bayesian network classifiers using ant colony optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000322157300007"}
