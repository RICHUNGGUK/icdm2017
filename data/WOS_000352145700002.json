Based on human IQ calculations, the paper first establishes a 2014 Internet Intelligence Scale and designs an intelligence test bank regarding search engines. Then, an intelligence test using such test bank is carried out on 50 typical search engines from 25 countries and regions across the world. Meanwhile, another intelligence test is also conducted in the human age groups of 6, 12 and 18 years using the same test bank and rules. Next, the absolute IQ and the relative IQ of the 53 test subjects are calculated in accordance with the test results. Finally, the data mining method is applied to find out the features of search engines reflected in the Internet intelligence test and the intelligence difference between search engines and human beings.", "paper_title": "World Search Engine IQ Test Based on the Internet IQ Evaluation Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000352145700002"}
