Generally speaking, this kind of problem falls within the umbrella of interoperability between local reference information models. This position paper discuss some idea on this field and traces a research roadmap, to make enterprise interoperable on the basis of this statement to face interoperability of RIMs by focusing the attention on the product. By applying a transformation between local information models into an \"ontological reference model\" centred on the product it is possible to insure applications interoperability.", "paper_title": "Product-driven enterprise interoperability for manufacturing systems integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000241427500021"}
