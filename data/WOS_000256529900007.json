Function S-rough sets have dynamic characteristic, law characteristic and law-hiding characteristic. Function S-rough sets can generate (f) over bar -hiding law and -hiding law. By engrafting, crossing, and penetrating between the information security theory and function S-rough sets, the security hiding and the authentication of f-hiding law and (f) over bar -hiding law are given respectively in this paper. The fusion and share between function S-rough sets and information security theory is a new research direction of the application of information law in information system.", "paper_title": "Function S-rough sets and security-authentication of hiding law", "paper_id": "WOS:000256529900007"}
