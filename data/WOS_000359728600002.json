Several variations of the acclaimed Szpilrajn's theorem have been provided, inclusive of the case when some order conditions between elements are imposed on the extension. We extend the analysis of that topic by Alcantud to the fuzzy case. By appealing to generators to decompose (fuzzy) preference relations into strict preference and indifference relations, we give general extension results for the corresponding concept of compatible extension of a fuzzy reflexive relation. Then we investigate the conditions under which compatible order extensions exist such that certain elements are connected by the asymmetric part, resp., and certain other elements by the symmetric part, to respective elements with degree 1.
