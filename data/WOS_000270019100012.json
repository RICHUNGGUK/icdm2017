We define incidence energy of the graph G, denoted by IE(G), as the sum of the singular values of its incidence matrix. We are interested to find the relation between the energy and the incidence energy of graphs. For any graph G we obtain a bipartite graph (G) over cap such that IE(G) = E((G) over cap)/2. Moreover we find some similar upper and lower bounds of energy 2 for incidence energy. Finally we show that for any proper subgraph H of the graph G, IE(G) > IE(H).", "paper_title": "INCIDENCE ENERGY OF A GRAPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000270019100012"}
