First, we investigate the R-D characteristics of the texture and depth map of the coded view, as well as the quality dependency between the virtual view and the coded view. Second, an optimal bit allocation scheme is developed to allocate target bits for both the texture and depth maps of different views. Meanwhile, a simplified model parameter estimation scheme is adopted to speed up the coding process. Finally, the experimental results on various 3-D video sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves excellent R-D efficiency and bit rate accuracy compared to benchmark algorithms.", "paper_title": "Rate-Distortion Optimized Rate Control for Depth Map-Based 3-D Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000314717800014"}
