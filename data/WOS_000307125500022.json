And the growing process variations can no longer be ignored. Meanwhile, reducing power consumption remains to be one of the design goals. In this paper, a variation-aware supply voltage assignment (SVA) technique combining dual assignment and dynamic scaling is proposed on a statistical platform, to minimize circuit power under an aging-aware timing constraint. The experimental results show that our SVA technique can mitigate on average 62% of the NBTI-induced circuit delay degradation. Compared with guard-banding and single scaling approaches, our approach saves more energy.", "paper_title": "Variation-Aware Supply Voltage Assignment for Simultaneous Power and Aging Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000307125500022"}
