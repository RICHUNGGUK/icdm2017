The key idea is that the uplink ICI from individual cells is approximated with a lognormal distribution with statistical parameters being determined analytically. Accordingly, the aggregated uplink ICI is approximated with another lognormal distribution and its statistical parameters can be determined from those of individual cells using Fenton-Wilkson method. Analytic expressions of uplink ICI are derived with two traditional frequency reuse schemes, namely integer frequency reuse schemes with factor 1 (IFR-1) and factor 3 (IFR-3). Uplink fractional power control and lognormal shadowing are modeled. System performances in terms of signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) and spectrum efficiency are also derived. The proposed model has been validated by simulations.", "paper_title": "Statistical Model of OFDMA Cellular Networks Uplink Interference Using Lognormal Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697000028"}
