The approach is computationally fast and able to effectively remove undesirable noise while preserving prominent geometric features of a 3D mesh surface such as curved surface regions, sharp edges, and fine details. Extensive experimental results on various 3D models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm, which yields satisfactory output results in just one single iteration.", "paper_title": "A Finite Volume Framework for Geometric Surface Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000337792800006"}
