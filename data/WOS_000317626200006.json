The resultant activity accounts for the sleep stage transitions. In accordance with sleep cycles timing, the model proves to be able to reproduce the clustering and randomness of those peculiar transient synchronized EEG patterns (TSEP) described in normal human sleep and supposed to be related to the dynamic building up of NREM sleep until its stabilization against perturbations.", "paper_title": "DOUBLE-LAYERED MODELS CAN EXPLAIN MACRO AND MICRO STRUCTURE OF HUMAN SLEEP", "paper_id": "WOS:000317626200006"}
