The conditioning, velocity, payload and stiffness indices are developed to compare the performance of the three parallel manipulators. An optimum region is investigated. A comparison of the results indicates that the conditioning performance, payload performance and stiffness performance of the 4-RRR manipulator is the best, and those performances of the 2-RRR one is the worst. The three manipulators have different output velocity performance. The 4-RRR and 2-RRR manipulators have the largest and smallest optimum region, respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
