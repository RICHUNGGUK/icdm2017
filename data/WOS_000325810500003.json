The results give the joint distribution between each pair of the variables. Also an isoline of the concurrence return periods between the AMFMs of the two stations was drawn up.", "paper_title": "Bivariate analysis of typical hydrological series of the yellow river", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500003"}
