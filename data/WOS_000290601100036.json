The function is based on a ROADM graph proposed for representing the ROADMs, and can output lightpath routes usable in the network together with the total optical loss values. The losses can be calculated by only 3 basic values for the ROADM and one value for the fiber link in the network. The experimental results clarified that the difference was within 1 dB between measured and calculated values. The system. enables the network administrators to manage the lightpath reconfigurations effectively without errors by avoiding making unlinked lightpaths through routes with higher losses to connect nodes, before the reconfiguration.", "paper_title": "LIGHTPATH ROUTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR IP-OVER-CWDM NETWORKS WITH ROADMS, BASED ON A ROADM GRAPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100036"}
