In the proposed method we first construct the skeleton of protein models by an improved L-1-medial skeleton extraction. The skeleton information is then used to form a local radius descriptor. Finally, the shape similarity of protein models is compared by using the local radius descriptor based on the absolute degree of grey incidence. Experimental results show that the improved L-1-medial skeleton of protein models can describe the shapes of the protein models well. The local descriptor based on the skeleton combined with the absolute degree of grey incidence shows satisfactory performance for comparing the shape similarity of protein CPK models.", "paper_title": "Shape similarity comparison of protein CPK models based on improved L-1-medial skeleton", "paper_id": "WOS:000341760600004"}
