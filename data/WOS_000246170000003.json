With the objective of minimizing the maximum load, we show that the layered LPT algorithm has a tight worst case ratio of 2 - 1/m. With the objective of maximizing the minimum load, we show that the layered LPT algorithm has a tight worst case ratio of 1/m for the general case and, with certain conditions, the worst ratio can be improved to m/(2m - 1) for the general k case and to (m - 1) / (2m - 3) for the k = 3 case.
