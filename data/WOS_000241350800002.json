There exists a large body of work in developing representations for 3D shapes. However, there has been limited work done in developing domain-dependent benchmark databases for 3D shape searching. We propose a benchmark database for evaluating shape-based search methods relevant to the mechanical engineering domain. Twelve different shape descriptors belonging to three categories, namely: (1) feature vector-based, (2) histogram-based, and (3) view-based, are compared using the benchmark database. The main contributions of this paper are the development of a new engineering shape benchmark and an understanding of the effectiveness of different shape representations for classes of engineering parts. Overall, it was found that view-based representations yielded better retrieval results for a majority of shape classes, while no single method performed best for all shape categories.
