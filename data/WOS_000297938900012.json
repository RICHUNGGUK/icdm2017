This work focuses on implementing the algorithm using the BIST with diagnostic support for a 64 X 8 bit embedded SRAM. The algorithm can locate and identify all the target faults in SRAM. The BIST with diagnostic support is realized by programming using very high speed integrated circuit hardware description language codes and proved very valuable for diagnosing the target faults. When analyzing experimental results, the fault dictionary is constructed from the simulated responses under the given test algorithm and fault models. The fault dictionary shows that the algorithm has a completely diagnostic ratio.", "paper_title": "AN EFFECTIVE TEST ALGORITHM AND DIAGNOSTIC IMPLEMENTATION FOR EMBEDDED STATIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000297938900012"}
