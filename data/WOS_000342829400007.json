The increasing number of apps available on markets and the profits that developers and companies obtain are relevant enough to seriously consider the way apps are developed. The always-changing environment in which apps are produced makes agile a convenient methodology to follow. Although agile allows the development team to quickly adjust the requisites to the new customer's needs, there is a lack of research on how agile methodologies can be explicitly adapted to develop mass-market applications. Many references explain how to design and code a mobile app, but there is not much knowledge about other stages in the development process. Adapting an agile methodology to the development of mass-market applications would provide project teams with a clear guide to successfully produce an app without missing any step in the process. This paper describes a case study in which an agile mass-market application development process is followed. The proposed process also considers marketing issues as they are necessary to publicize a mass-market application. This process has been followed and refined for several years in the development of the institutional apps at Carlos III University of Madrid.
