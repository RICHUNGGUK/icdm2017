Based on a review of the feature technology and previous research work, this paper focuses on the modeling of intricate relations among features of different design aspects. A concept of feature parameter map that leads to a constraint mapping method is proposed. Further, features are classified into different levels: and information management for product life-cycle support is considered. The application of this method is demonstrated with the conceptual design and optimization of a gearbox as the study case. In addition, an extended feature system for product development was explored. With a spreadsheet package and a computer aided design (CAD) tool, the product model generation, change management and final optimization of the case assembly including its bulk shape, have been achieved. Two important information chains were used to address the aspect of \"design for post-manufacture services\" with concurrent engineering consideration, i.e. a field installation pattern and a set of wrapping dimensions for product transport packaging. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of change management, a different product derivative model was regenerated by adopting and changing the values of a main conceptual feature. The result is promising. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Parametric feature constraint modeling and mapping in product development", "paper_id": "WOS:000307140300007"}
