The CRC can operate at a half-rate speed to provide an adequate locking range with reasonable jitter and power consumption because both clock edges sample the data waveforms. Implemented by 0.18-mu m CMOS technique, experimental results demonstrate that it can achieve the phase noise of the recovered clock about -121.55 dBc/Hz at 100-kHz offset and -129.58 dBc/Hz at 1-MMz offset with +/- 25 MHz lock range, while operating at the input data rate of 1.55 Gb/s.", "paper_title": "Injection-locked clock recovery using a multiplexed oscillator for half-rate data-recovered applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000252617400045"}
