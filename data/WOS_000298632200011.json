The API is implemented using the open-source SCA implementation-embedded (OSSIE) developed at Virginia Tech. Our implementation verified that the SA API can be utilized in software communication architecture (SCA)-based software defined radio (SDR) systems. We also verified that the Transceiver API can be realized with a real radio frequency (RF) transceiver module such as universal software radio peripheral2 (USRP2). The SA API enables various functions of multi-antenna systems such as beamforming and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) of spatial multiplexing. These are core technologies prevalent in 4G mobile communication systems. In order to support multi-antenna structures, the Transceiver API has first been extended for multichannel use. The paper details how the API is extended using OSSIE and the current status of the API as a standard within the Wireless Innovation Forum.", "paper_title": "Implementation of smart antenna API and transceiver API in software communication architecture for a wireless innovation forum standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000298632200011"}
