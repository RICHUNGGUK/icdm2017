With the aid of this technique, we are able to do the equivalent of partial bitstream encryption on low-cost FPGAs, which is only featured on high-end FPGAs. Low-cost FPGAs do not even have built-in support for encrypted (full) bitstreams. Through DPSR, our PUF implementation does not steal real estate from the encrypted design. We also present a new DPSR flow for Xilinx FPGAs, which is difference-based but still allows modular design. It works regardless of the amount of difference between Partial Reconfiguration (PR) modules and is called DPSR-LD, where LD stands for Large-Difference. DPSR-LD is an enabler especially for Spartan-6 FPGA family, as Xilinx currently supports PR on Spartan-6 only through the difference-based flow and only for small differences. Our DPSR-LD also includes a controller that interfaces to the ICAP and can process compressed bitstreams. It is called ICAP+ and occupies only 1% of Spartan-6 slices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
