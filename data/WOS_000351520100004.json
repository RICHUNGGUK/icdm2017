To address the issue, the technologies of the Internet of Things are used to offer the possibilities to easily track the processes in the production, storage, transportation, sale, and even using phases of foods. This paper, therefore, introduces the design of an electronic pedigree system for food safety, which uses electronic pedigrees to enhance the safety of food supply. The system implements an extension of the pedigree standard of EPCglobal, and offers a more trustworthily tracking service to monitor and supervise the production and supply of food. We discuss the key issues of the design, and implement a prototype to evaluate the feasibility of the design. Finally, we analyze the trustworthiness assurance and security of our electronic pedigree system.", "paper_title": "The design of an electronic pedigree system for food safety", "paper_id": "WOS:000351520100004"}
