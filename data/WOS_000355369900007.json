Numerical simulations of two engineering examples demonstrate that the present method has high efficiency and very robust convergence performance, and reduces the number of iterations. In addition, the proposed method can provide more efficient and numerically stable approximation of the true loads, compared with the Landweber iteration method. The results validate the stability and the effectiveness of the present method and coincide with the results of the theoretical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
