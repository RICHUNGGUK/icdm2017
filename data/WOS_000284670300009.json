Considering a suitable state formulation as well as a consistent inner product, the Galerkin projection of the compressible flow Navier-Stokes equations, the high-fidelity (HF) model, onto a low-dimensional basis determined by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), leads to a polynomial quadratic ODE system relevant to the prediction of main flow features. A fictitious domain deformation technique is yielded by the Hadamard formulation of HF model and validated at HF level. This approach captures airfoil profile deformation by a modification of the boundary conditions whereas the spatial domain remains unchanged. A mixed POD gathering information from snapshot series associated with several airfoil profiles can be defined. The temporal coefficients in POD expansion are shape-dependent while spatial POD modes are not. In the ROM, airfoil deformation is introduced by a steady forcing term. ROM reliability towards airfoil deformation is demonstrated for the prediction of HF-resolved as well as unknown intermediate configurations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
