However, this model requires a significant computational effort which translates in time consuming simulations. A methodology using surface B-splines fitting was developed for speeding the prediction of the multicomponent equilibrium with IAS theory. As a case study, a breakthrough of an enantiomer bi-component mixture in a fixed bed was simulated and a speed-up of 57.9% was achieved while maintaining the accuracy of IAS multicomponent equilibrium prediction.
