It removes noisy borders, checks and corrects orientation, calculates and compensates the skew angle, crops the image standardizing document sizes, and finally compresses it according to user defined file format. BigBatch encompasses the best and recently developed algorithms for such kind of document images. BigBatch may work either in standalone or operator assisted modes. Besides that, BigBatch in standalone mode is able to process in clusters of workstations or in grids.", "paper_title": "BigBatch - An environment for processing monochromatic documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600080"}
