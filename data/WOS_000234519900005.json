This paper recalls the basics of the SET protocol and presents a new flaw: a dishonest client may purchase goods from an honest merchant (with the help of another merchant) for which he does not pay. Fortunately, by checking his balance sheet, the merchant may trace with the help of his bank the client and his accomplice. We also propose a modification to fix the flaw. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
