It has several applications in logistics and is known to be NP-hard. We develop a 2-approximation algorithm that is a significant improvement over the best constant approximation ratio of 5 derived from existing CTSPPD literature. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm also achieves good average performance over randomly generated instances. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
