This paper combines the use of ontologies and agent technologies to help in solving the heterogeneity problem in e-commerce negotiations. The result is an implementation of the Ontology-based Services, which apply a methodology that assesses lexical and semantic similarity among concepts represented in different ontologies. A solution integrating the Jade platform and OWL format is presented as well as an Ontology Interaction Protocol, which is combined with the FIPA Contract Net Protocol. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
