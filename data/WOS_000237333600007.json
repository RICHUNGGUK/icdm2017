We then use this to show that if S is a set of n points in general position, then the number square(S) of convex quadrilaterals determined by the points in S is at least 0.37553((n)(4)) + O(n(3)). This in turn implies that the rectilinear crossing number cr(K(n)) of the complete graph K(n)is at least 0.37553((n)(4)) + O(n(3)), and that Sylvester's Four Point Problem Constant is at least 0.37553.
