However, recent research indicates that few national clearinghouses function well, as the spatial data resources available cannot be satisfactorily accessed or optimally used. To improve the functionality, we propose that clearinghouses to be complemented with expert systems and semantic matching. The expert system facilitates automatic determination of candidate datasets and the conversion of the available data to the required data. A schema translator is also used to find similar data that might be used in other disciplines or other datasets by semantic matching. In order to accomplish this, we have developed a method of identifying available data and methods for data conversion. The methodology is implemented using standardized map services. Practical tests show that the discovery of available data in the clearinghouse satisfying users' requirements is substantially increased, which is an important step forward in building future SDIs.
