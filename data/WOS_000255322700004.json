A residual-based compact scheme for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. J Comput Phys 2001; 170(2): 642-75], is generalized to very high-orders of accuracy. Compactness is retained since for instance a 5th-order accurate dissipative approximation of a d-dimensional advection-diffusion problem can be achieved on a 5(d) stencil, without requiring the linear system solutions associated with usual compact schemes. Applications to 1D and 2D model problems are presented and demonstrate that the theoretical orders of accuracy can be achieved in practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
