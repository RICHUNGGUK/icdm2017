Such procedures are typically performed with C-arm angiography systems, and tomographic imaging is currently available only by using preprocedural computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Recent developments in C-arm CT (Angiographic CT) allow three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of low contrast details with angiography imaging systems for noncardiac applications. We propose a new approach for cardiac imaging that takes advantage of this improved contrast resolution and is based on intravenous contrast injection. The method is an analogue to multisegment reconstruction in cardiac CT adapted to the much slower rotational speed of C-arm CT. Motion of the heart is considered in the reconstruction process by retrospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-gating, using only projections acquired at a similar heart phase. A series of N almost identical rotational acquisitions is performed at different heart phases to obtain a complete data set at a minimum temporal resolution of 1 IN of the heart cycle time. First results in simulation, using an experimental phantom, and in preclinical in vivo studies showed that excellent image quality can be achieved.", "paper_title": "Towards cardiac C-arm computed tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000238781100010"}
