Interactive Hashing is used in an innovative way to test the receiver's adherence to the protocol. We show that (1 + epsilon)k uses of Bit OT suffice to implement String OT for k-bit strings. Our protocol represents a two-fold improvement over the best constructions in the literature and is asymptotically optimal. We then show that our construction can also accommodate weaker versions of Bit OT, thereby obtaining a significantly lower expansion factor compared to previous constructions. Besides increasing efficiency, our constructions allow the use of any 2-universal family of Hash Functions for performing Privacy Amplification. Of independent interest, our reduction illustrates the power of Interactive Hashing as an ingredient in the design of cryptographic protocols.", "paper_title": "Optimal reductions between Oblivious Transfers using Interactive Hashing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238574200013"}
