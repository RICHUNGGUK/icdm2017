Each probabilistic model component is newly composed of a phase parameter that characterises the composition rules of universal models and must be quantised to fulfill the single-valuedness condition. The algorithm for identification of modulus and phase parameters is also presented together with its interpretation with respect to complementarity principle.", "paper_title": "Quantum system modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000258687800007"}
