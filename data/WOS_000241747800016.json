In particular, a distributed power control and scheduling protocol is proposed to control the incurred delay of video streaming over multihop wireless ad hoc networks, as well as the multiple access interference (MAI). We also investigate the impacts of Doppler spread and noisy channel estimates upon the end-to-end video quality, and provide a relatively robust system which employs a combination of power control and coding/inter-leaving to combat the effects of Doppler spread by exploiting the increased time diversity when the Doppler spread becomes large. Thus, more robust end-to-end video quality can be achieved over a wide range of channel conditions.", "paper_title": "Qos guarantee and provisioning for real-time digital video over mobile ad hoc CDMA networks with cross-layer design", "paper_id": "WOS:000241747800016"}
