The advantages of our model are described as follows: First, it has good scalability and is suitable for large-scale distributed networks. Second, the authentication path is short, with no more than two entities intervening. Third, it does not require users to inquire about certificate revocation lists. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
