Motivated by this, we propose new spatial query processing algorithms to support Mobile Continuous Nearest Neighbor Query (MCNNQ) in wireless broadcast environments. Our solution provides a general client-server architecture for answering MCNNQ on objects with unknown, and possibly variable, movement types. Our solution enables the application of spatio-temporal access methods specifically designed for a particular type, to arbitrary movements without any false misses. Our algorithm does not require any conventional spatial index for MCNNQ processing. It can be adapted to static or moving objects, and does not require additional knowledge (e.g., direction of moving objects) beyond the maximum speed and the location of each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our location-based data dissemination algorithm significantly outperforms index-based solutions.", "paper_title": "A scalable energy-efficient continuous nearest neighbor search in wireless broadcast systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277454200010"}
