I18n filters are proposed as pluggable components in order to address issues when extracting knowledge from non-English Wikipedia editions. We report on our strategy for supporting the International Resource Identifier (IRI) and introduce two new extractors to complement the I18n filters. Additionally, the paper discusses the definition of Transparent Content Negotiation (TCN) rules for IRIs to address de-referencing and IRI serialization problems. The aim of this research is to establish best practices (complemented by software) to allow the DBpedia community to easily generate, maintain and properly interlink language-specific DBpedia editions. Furthermore, these best practices can be applied for the publication of Linked Data in non-Latin languages in general. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
