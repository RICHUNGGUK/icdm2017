Firstly, for case I), a linear control protocol is designed for cluster synchronization of multi-agent systems, and a method is presented to determine the final state with the initial conditions based on state-space decomposition. Secondly, we study case II), and design a control protocol based on the information of neighbors and that of two-hop neighbors (that is, neighbors' neighbors). Finally, two examples are studied by using our presented results. The study of illustrative examples with simulations shows that our results as well as designed control protocols work very well in studying the cluster synchronization of this class of multi-agent systems.", "paper_title": "Cluster synchronization of a class of multi-agent systems with a bipartite graph topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000332596000015"}
