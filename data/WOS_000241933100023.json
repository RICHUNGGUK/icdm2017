Through this, we extend some well-known properties of the SVD in evaluating the generalizability of single hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) with respect to the number of hidden layer neurons. The generalization capability of the SLFN is measured by the degree of linear independency of the patterns in hidden layer space, which can be indirectly quantified from the singular values obtained from the SVD, in a postlearning step. pruning/growing technique based on these singular values is then used to estimate the necessary number of neurons in the hidden layer. More importantly, we describe in detail properties of the SVD in determining the structure of a neural network particularly with respect to the robustness of the selected model.", "paper_title": "Estimating the number of hidden neurons in a feedforward network using the singular value decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241933100023"}
