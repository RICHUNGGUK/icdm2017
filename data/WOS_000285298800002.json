These bounds consider the case where a distinguishing sequence is used in forming state recognition and transition verification subsequences and identify the effects of overlapping among such subsequences. Empirical results show that the existing methods for construction of checking sequences provide checking sequences with lengths that are within acceptable distance to these lower bounds.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds on lengths of checking sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000285298800002"}
