The procedure is typically performed under image guidance, with freehand ultrasound and stereotactic mammography (SM) being the most common modalities used. To utilize the advantages of both modalities, a biopsy device combining three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS) and digital SM imaging with computer-aided needle guidance was developed. An implementation of a stereo camera method was applied to SM calibration, providing a target localization error of 0.35 mm. The 3-D transformation between the two imaging modalities was then derived, with a target registration error of 0.52 mm. Finally, the needle guidance error of the device was evaluated using tissue-mimicking phantoms, showing a sample mean and standard deviation of 0.44 +/- 0.22 and 0.49 +/- 0.27 mm for targets planned from 3DUS and SM images, respectively. These results suggest that a biopsy procedure guided using this device would successfully sample breast lesions at a size greater than or equal to the smallest typically detected in mammographic screening (similar to 2 mm).", "paper_title": "Registered 3-D ultrasound and digital stereotactic mammography for breast biopsy guidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000253558400010"}
