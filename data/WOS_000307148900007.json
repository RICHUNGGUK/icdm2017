Here, acoustic fluids are modelled by the BEM, whereas elastodynamic solids are discretized by the FEM. The fluid-solid coupling is carried out by an optimized iterative procedure. This coupling technique allows independent discretizations to be efficiently employed for both Boundary and Finite Element Methods, without any requirement of matching nodes at the fluid/solid common interfaces. Optimal relaxation parameters are computed, in order to ensure the convergence of the iterative procedure, properly dealing with the frequency domain wave propagation ill-posed problem.
