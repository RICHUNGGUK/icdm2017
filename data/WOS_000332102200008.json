It is composed of channels inserted into a distributed structure, and the frequency agility is obtained by activating one or more of them. The concept is validated with measurements realized on a 3-channel prototype structure implemented in the United Monolithic Semiconductors (UMS) PPH25 GaAs technology from UMS. This filter is tunable throughout the X and Ku bands. This first prototype yields encouraging results: the center frequency can be tuned between 9.7 and 14 GHz, with an average gain of 10 dB throughout this range and a noise figure between 7 and 11 dB. The filter occupies 13.5 mm(2) of area and consumes 10.5 mA per active stage from a 4 V supplying voltage. It is designed for wideband and agile receivers.", "paper_title": "A tunable and reconfigurable MMIC active filter in GaAs technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000332102200008"}
