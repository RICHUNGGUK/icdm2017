In the algorithm, a global minimum is searched by using two operators: one modifies a cluster configuration by moving atoms to the most stable positions on the surface of a cluster and the other gives a perturbation on a cluster configuration by moving atoms near the center of mass of a cluster. The moved atoms are selected by employing contribution of the atoms to the potential energy of a cluster. It was possible to find new global minima for LJ(506), LJ(521), LJ(536), LJ(537), LJ(538), and LJ(541) together with putative global minima of LJ clusters of 10-561 atoms reported in the literature. This indicates that the present method is clever and efficient for cluster geometry optimization.", "paper_title": "Clever and efficient method for searching optimal geometries of Lennard- Jones clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000240701700022"}
