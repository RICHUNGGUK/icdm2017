In this paper we present a novel sensor network that localizes with the help of two modalities: cameras and non-imaging sensors. A set of two cameras is initially used to localize the motes of a wireless sensor network. Motes subsequently collaborate to estimate the location of a target using their non-imaging sensors. Our results show that the combination of imaging and non-imaging modalities successfully achieves the dual goal of self- and target-localization. Specifically, we found through simulation and experimental validation that cameras can localize motes deployed in a 100 m x 100 m area with a few cm error. Moreover, a network of motes equipped with magnetometers can, once localized, estimate the location of magnetic targets within a few cm.", "paper_title": "Target localization in camera wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000208396100004"}
