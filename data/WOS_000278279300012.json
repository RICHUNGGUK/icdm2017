Design/methodology/approach - The paper intends to examine the organizational intervention on system usage extent. Unlike previous studies, this research adopts a feature-centered approach to examine the construct of system usage extent, and proposes that organizational supports such as management support and technical support impact the individual system usage extent. Findings - Results show that technical support from the organization, specifically technical assistance and technical consulting channels, have a positive impact on system usage extent; however, management support does not show a significant effect. A post hoc analysis is conducted in an attempt to explicate the relationships between organization interventions and the feature usage of particular systems. Originality/value - The paper has the following implications. First, this study discusses system usage extent from a feature-centered perspective and develops a method to assess the degree of system usage. Second, the scheme for evaluating system usage extent developed in our study can be used to measure the actual system usage. Lastly, an ad hoc correlation analysis was performed to provide a detailed understanding of the relationship between organizational initiatives.", "paper_title": "The impact of organizational intervention on system usage extent", "paper_id": "WOS:000278279300012"}
