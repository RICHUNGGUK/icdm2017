Two non-lethal, hemispherical blast waves, each of which corresponds to the detonation of a high explosive charge, are considered for configurations in which the body is facing either towards or away from the explosive charge. The shock wave interactions that arise when the blast wave impinges upon the head are characterized and correlated with the resulting transient surface pressures, forces, and moments on the head. The transient forces and moments are compared to those of an analytical model based upon the work of Zaslavskii et al. [J Appl Mech Tech Phys 2001:42(3):533-7]. who derived expressions for the drag force on an arbitrary-shaped body due to the interaction with a weak to moderate strength shock wave. The results of this study indicate that Zaslavskii et al.'s model provides a straightforward means of estimating the transient loads on the head during a non-lethal blast wave interaction.(C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
