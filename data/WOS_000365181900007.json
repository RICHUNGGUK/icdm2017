Four local feature extraction methods (LBP, LPQ, HOG and BSIF) are investigated for both face texture and shape description. Extensive experiments on three publicly available Kinect face databases are reported. The experimental analysis yields into interesting findings. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of Kinect depth data in face analysis is provided along with the description of the available databases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
