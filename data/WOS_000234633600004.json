They can also conceivably be employed for the purposes of re-optimization after branching or the addition of cutting planes. We give a survey of various cutting plane approaches for SDP in this paper. These cutting plane approaches arise from various perspectives, and include techniques based on interior point cutting plane approaches, non-differentiable optimization, and finally an approach which mimics the simplex method for linear programming ( LP). We present an accessible introduction to various cutting plane approaches that have appeared in the literature. We place these methods in a unifying framework which illustrates how each approach arises as a natural enhancement of a primordial LP cutting plane scheme based on a semi-infinite formulation of the SDP.", "paper_title": "A unifying framework for several cutting plane methods for semidefinite programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000234633600004"}
