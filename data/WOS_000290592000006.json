This research is motivated by the observation that sensors in close proximity normally present similar readings. We propose to employ Gaussian mixture modeling as a statistical means to build a probability density function for multivariate spatial neighborhood sensor readings. Outlying sensors can be reliably detected since they exhibit extremely low density values. Our extensive simulation evaluation validates the proposed model-based approach for outlier detection in sensor networks.", "paper_title": "A Model-Based Approach for Outlier Detection in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290592000006"}
