The model was used to simulate the flow in a tube with an indentation moving at different frequencies. The model was validated for a two-dimensional channel with a moving indentation. The results exhibited good agreement with the available experimental results. The results show that a single vortex was formed at a wall frequency of 0.1 Hz and was swept out of the tube at the end of the period. At a higher frequency of I Hz, vortex doubling occurred with reverse flow dominating downstream of the indentation. The results also show that the wall shear stress was larger for the higher frequency case of the moving indentation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
