The cost of each sensor includes a fixed component f, and a variable component that is a convex function of the diameter of the field-of-view area. When only one type of sensor or, in general. one type of disc, is available, then a simple polynomial algorithm solves the problem. When (here are different types of sensors, the problem becomes hard. A branch-and-bound algorithm as well as an efficient heuristic are developed for the special case in which the variable cost component of each sensor is proportional to the square of the measure of the field-of-view area. The heuristic very often obtains the optimal solution as shown in extensive computational testing.", "paper_title": "Covering a line segment with variable radius discs", "paper_id": "WOS:000262882500007"}
