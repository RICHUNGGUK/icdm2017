In this paper we first show that the construction of these meshes can be Computerized using a relatively simple algorithm based on the concept of a Coatmelec lattice. Then, we present a generalized finite difference method which provides a numerical solution of a partial differential equation over an arbitrary domain, using the generated meshes. The accuracy and mesh adaptivity of the method is evaluated using elliptical equations in several domains. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
