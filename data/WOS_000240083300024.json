A binary-tree hierarchical fuzzy system with typical FLUs (fuzzy logic units) is defined. The analytical expression of HFS is derived, and the system is shown to preserve universal approximation property. A simple example is also given to show the theory.", "paper_title": "Universal approximation of binary-tree hierarchical fuzzy systems with typical FLUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300024"}
