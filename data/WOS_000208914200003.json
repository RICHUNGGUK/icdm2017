But while providing convenience to individuals and organizations, these applications can pose a significant remote user authentication challenge. Current authentication systems can be strengthened by adding an additional biometric layer to an existing authentication process. This paper addresses implementing such a solution by 1) presenting a novel biometric method that uses key-press pressure and timing patterns from a typed password to determine whether the person typing it is its true owner (even with a compromised PIN); and 2) investigating differences in perceptions of biometric keypads between two user groups, nursing and computing majors. Results reveal that combining pressure and timing patterns leads to better authentication compared with timing patterns alone. Furthermore, nursing majors are more cautious in accepting biometric keypad technology than computing majors, suggesting that care must be taken when introducing such technologies to different groups of people.", "paper_title": "Typing Biometric Keypads: Combining Keystroke Time and Pressure Features to Improve Authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000208914200003"}
