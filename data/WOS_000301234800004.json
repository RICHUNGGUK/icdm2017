This problem may be addressed by the weighting method, constraint method, ranking method, and various metaheuristic methods. However, none of these methods can guarantee the complete Pareto-optimal solution set, which would potentially lead to suboptimal decisions. In this article, a parametric method is suggested to solve the bi-objective pavement maintenance and rehabilitation-scheduling problem. The effectiveness and efficiency of the parametric method is investigated and demonstrated through a case study using the real-world data set from the Dallas District's Pavement Management Information System. A performance comparison between the widely used weighting method and the parametric method clearly justifies the computational advantages of the parametric method.", "paper_title": "Network-Level Road Pavement Maintenance and Rehabilitation Scheduling for Optimal Performance Improvement and Budget Utilization", "paper_id": "WOS:000301234800004"}
