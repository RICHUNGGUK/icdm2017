In this study, several filtering schemes are presented to filter the shape sensitivity in level set-based structural topology optimization methods. It is revealed that filtering of the shape sensitivity can yield convergence with less iterations without considerably increasing the computing time of each iteration step. Thus, it can improve the overall computational efficiency. The validity of the method is tested on both the mean compliance minimization problem and the compliant mechanisms design problem.", "paper_title": "Filter the shape sensitivity in level set-based topology optimization methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000355760000004"}
