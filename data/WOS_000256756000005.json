In the attempt to extend our results to general undirected trees, we completely characterize the complexity of the problem in star networks by providing polynomial time optimal algorithms for g <= 2 and proving the intractability of the problem for any fixed g > 2. While for general topologies, the problem was known to be NP-hard g not constant, the complexity for fixed values of g was still an open question. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
