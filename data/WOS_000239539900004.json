Design/methodology/approach - To avoid large cancellation errors in cases where the demagnetizing field is high a difference field concept is used. This requires the computation of sources of the scalar potential of the excitation field. Findings - A new formulation to compute these sources is presented. The improved computational accuracy is demonstrated with numerical examples. Originality/value - The paper develops a novel formulation for the computation of sources of scalar excitation potential.", "paper_title": "Accuracy improvement in nonlinear magnetostatic field computations with integral equation methods and indirect total scalar potential formulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900004"}
