The standard approach to visualize such settings is ray tracing in four-dimensional spacetimes where the direction of the physical propagation of light is reversed. GeoViS implements this ray tracing principle making use of the Motion4D library that handles the spacetime metrics, the integration of geodesics, and the description of objects defined with respect to local reference frames. In combination with the GeodesicViewer, GeoViS might be a valuable tool for graduate students to get a deeper understanding in the visual effects of special and general relativity.
