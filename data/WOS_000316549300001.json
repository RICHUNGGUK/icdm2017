This algorithm can model the various shapes, sizes, and angularity of coarse aggregates. The shapes, sizes, and angularity of the generated aggregates can be correlated to those of actual aggregates. Then, algorithms were developed to model coarse aggregate gradation accurately and place the coarse aggregates randomly within the sample. Finally, algorithms were developed to generate the asphalt mastic. The triaxial compression test of the discrete-element sample of the asphalt mixture with the nominal maximum aggregate size of 16 mm was simulated to predict its dynamic modulus. The results indicate that the discrete-element model generated using the algorithms developed in this paper can predict the mixture modulus across a range of loading frequencies.
