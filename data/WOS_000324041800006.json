Now, the main idea in most existing localization algorithms has been that a mobile anchor node (e.g., global positioning system-equipped nodes) broadcasts its coordinates to help other unknown nodes to localize themselves while moving according to a specified trajectory. This method not only reduces the cost of WSNs but also gets high localization accuracy. In this case, a basic problem is that the path planning of the mobile anchor node should move along the trajectory to minimize the localization error and to localize the unknown nodes. In this paper, we propose a Localization algorithm with a Mobile Anchor node based on Trilateration (LMAT) in WSNs. LMAT algorithm uses a mobile anchor node to move according to trilateration trajectory in deployment area and broadcasts its current position periodically. Simulation results show that the performance of our LMAT algorithm is better than that of other similar algorithms.
