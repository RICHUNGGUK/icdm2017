Even though a large portion of this data concerns humans, however, retrieval of human actions has received relatively little attention. Presented in this paper is a video retrieval system that can be used to perform a content-based query on a large database of videos very efficiently. Furthermore, it is shown that by using ABRS-SVM, a technique for incorporating Relevance feedback (RF) on the search results, it is possible to quickly achieve useful results even when dealing with very complex human action queries, such as in Hollywood movies.
