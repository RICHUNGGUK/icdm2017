In this paper we propose a framework in which we adopt the three-layer architecture of agent-based negotiation to the problem of service level agreement negotiation in services grids. We report on the first experience with an implementation of the framework in the context of the WS-Agreement specification provided by the Global Grid Forum and present lessons learnt when using this framework in a simple practical scenario.", "paper_title": "A framework for automated negotiation of service level agreements in services grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100007"}
