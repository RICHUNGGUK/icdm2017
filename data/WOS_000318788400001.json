The change histories of software systems hold useful information that describes how artifacts evolved. Evolution-based metrics, which are the means to quantify the change history, are potentially good indicators of the changes in a software system. The objective of this paper is to derive and validate (theoretically and empirically) a set of evolution-based metrics as potential indicators of the change-prone classes of an object-oriented system when moving from one release to the next. Release-by-release statistical prediction models were built in different ways. The results indicate that the proposed evolution-based metrics measure different dimensions from those of typical product metrics. Additionally, several evolution-based metrics were found to be correlated with the change-proneness of classes. Moreover, the results indicate that more accurate prediction of class change-proneness is achieved when the evolution-based metrics are combined with product metrics.
