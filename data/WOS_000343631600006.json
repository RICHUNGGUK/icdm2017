Due to the limits of computational capacity, the grid size of the numerical model is generally much larger than the turbine rotor diameter. Two models, i.e. a local grid refinement model and a coarse grid model, are employed and an idealized estuary is set up. The local grid refinement model is constructed to simulate the power generation of an isolated turbine and its impacts on hydrodynamics. The model is then used to determine the deployment of turbine farm and quantify a combined thrust coefficient for multiple turbines located in a grid element of coarse grid model. The model results indicate that the performance of power extraction is affected by array deployment, with more power generation from outer rows than inner rows due to velocity deficit influence of upstream turbines. Model results also demonstrate that the large-scale turbine farm has significant effects on the hydrodynamics. The tidal currents are attenuated within the turbine swept area, and both upstream and downstream of the array. While the currents are accelerated above and below turbines, which is contributed to speeding up the wake mixing process behind the arrays. The water levels are heightened in both low and high water levels as the turbine array spanning the full width of estuary. The magnitude of water level change is found to increase with the array expansion, especially at the low water level. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
