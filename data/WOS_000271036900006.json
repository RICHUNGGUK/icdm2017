In this paper, we propose two modified HS methods to deal with the uni-modal and multi-modal optimization problems. The first modified HS method is based on the fusion of the HS and Differential Evolution (DE) technique, namely, HS-DE. The DE is employed here to optimize the members of the HS memory. The second modified HS method utilizes a novel HS memory management approach, and it targets at handling the multi-modal problems. Several nonlinear functions are used to demonstrate and verify the effectiveness of our two new HS methods.", "paper_title": "UNI-MODAL AND MULTI-MODAL OPTIMIZATION USING MODIFIED HARMONY SEARCH METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271036900006"}
