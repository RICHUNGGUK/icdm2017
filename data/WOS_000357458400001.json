The parameters are adjusted by optimizing evaluation functions, compared with reference results of energy levels or band structure calculated by, for example, the density functional theory. By introducing the evaluation function, the automatic optimization of the parameters for small molecules and clusters is achieved, which makes it easy to determine an accurate parameter set and a wide application of the TB scheme. A practical procedure of parameter optimization is demon-strated for solid-state electrolytes of Li4GeS4 and Li3PS4.", "paper_title": "Parameter determination procedure for extended Huckel approximation and its application for solid-state electrolytes", "paper_id": "WOS:000357458400001"}
