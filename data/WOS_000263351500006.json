We show that the result is more general than the recent discrete fixed point theorem of Iimura et al. (J. Math. Econ. 41(8):1030-1036, [2005]) by deriving it from ours. The simplicial approach applied in the development of the new theorem reveals a clear structural comparison with the classical approach for the continuous case.", "paper_title": "A Simplicial Approach for Discrete Fixed Point Theorems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263351500006"}
