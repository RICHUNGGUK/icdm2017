The authors set their values to 1, 2, 0.5 and 0.5, respectively, which have been universally used. Here, we propose to use NM to calibrate itself. A computational experiment is carried out and results show that the parameter values originally proposed by NM are better than those obtained with more sophisticated ways.", "paper_title": "Technical Note: Relating to the Parameter Values Given by Nelder and Mead in their Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000350219300010"}
