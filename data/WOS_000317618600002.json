Flooding is a simple mechanism to realise broadcasting, but it has high redundancy of retransmissions, leading to low transmission efficiency. In this paper, we propose a 3D broadcast protocol, called 3DOBP (3-Dimensional Optimised Broadcast Protocol), to achieve optimised transmission efficiency by partitioning the 3D space into multi-layer hexagonal prisms of a hexagon ring pattern in each layer. The transmission efficiency of the proposed protocol is 1/p, which is higher than those of polyhedron-filling broadcasting approaches using cubes, hexagon prisms, rhombic dodecahedrons, and truncated octahedrons.", "paper_title": "A 3-Dimensional broadcast protocol with optimised transmission efficiency in wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317618600002"}
