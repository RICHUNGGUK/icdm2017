This paper provides two new characterizations of finitely generated Taylor varieties. The first characterization is using absorbing subalgebras and the second one cyclic terms. These new conditions allow us to reprove the conjecture of Bang-Jensen and Hell (proved by the authors) and the characterization of locally finite Taylor varieties using weak near-unanimity terms (proved by McKenzie and Maroti) in an elementary and self-contained way.", "paper_title": "ABSORBING SUBALGEBRAS, CYCLIC TERMS, AND THE CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000302505000007"}
