Moreover, STS-via can also dissipate heat, which is a much more serious problem in 3D ICs than in 2D ICs. Since the through-the-silicon via is large and can only be inserted into whitespace of the device layer, planning STS-via for thermal optimization may affect the interconnection wire length. Therefore, in order to make STS-via planning more flexible, we integrated STS-via with pin assignment. In this paper, we use min-cost maximum flow algorithm for STS-via planning and pin assignment simultaneously. Experimental results show that our approach can reduce both temperature and wire length effectively with short runtime. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.
