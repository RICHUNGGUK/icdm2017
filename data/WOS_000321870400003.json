Based on 3GPP \"SIPTO\" (Selected IP Traffic Offload) architecture, this paper proposes dynamic SIPTO mechanism (D-SIPTO) for traffic offloading in LTE HeNB networks, which combines fast fourier transform (FFT) based IP traffic classification scheme (FFTTCS) with the dynamic traffic offload path selection algorithm (DTOPSA). Simulation results show that FFTTCS can realize on-line traffic classification with similar precisions but only using less than 10 % of the time needed by existing methods. Combined with DTOPSA, the proposed D-SIPTO can reduce the core network traffic by 60 % while selecting the optimal offload path according to the type of traffic to be offloaded.", "paper_title": "FFT Traffic Classification-Based Dynamic Selected IP Traffic Offload Mechanism for LTE HeNB Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321870400003"}
