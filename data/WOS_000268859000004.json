Here those transducers are extensively and systematically studied. Their main properties are identified and their relation to classical top-down tree transducers is exactly characterized. The obtained properties completely explain the Hasse diagram of the induced classes of tree transformations. In addition, it is shown that most interesting classes of transformations computed by extended top-down tree transducers are not closed under composition.", "paper_title": "THE POWER OF EXTENDED TOP-DOWN TREE TRANSDUCERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000268859000004"}
