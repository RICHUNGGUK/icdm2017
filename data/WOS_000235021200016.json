In particular we consider dependence of a characterization of proteomics map on the number of proteins considered in the analysis. We examined a collection of proteomics maps in which we approximately doubled the number of spots to be used for quantitative analysis, considering cases of maps having 30, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1054 protein spots. For each case we have compared the similarity-dissimilarity results for five proteomics maps of rat liver cells associated with the control group and four proliferators administrated by intraperitoneal injection. We found that proteins maps based on a set of about the 250 most abundant proteins spots suffice for a satisfactory numerical characterization of such maps.", "paper_title": "Dependence of a characterization of proteomics maps on the number of protein spots considered", "paper_id": "WOS:000235021200016"}
