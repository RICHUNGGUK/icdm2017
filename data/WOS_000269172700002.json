The objective function is selected for maximization of reactive power reserve subjected to usual operating constraints at an operating point. Probabilistic risk of voltage collapse has been used for maintaining desired level of voltage stability margin. This risk of voltage collapse is calculated accounting uncertainties in system parameters and control variables. Probabilistic risk of voltage collapse has been obtained by a trained Radial Basis Function network. Developed algorithm has been implemented on 6-bus, 14-bus and 25-bus IEEE test systems. Results have been compared with those obtained using Davidon-Fletcher-Powell's (DFP) method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
