It gives particular attention to the interplay between three kinds of activities: design of high-level programming systems for AI, design of truth-maintenance systems, and the development of nonmonotonic logics. This was not merely a development from logic to implementation: in several cases there was a development from a system design to a corresponding logic. The article concludes with some reflections on the roles and relationships between logicist theory and system design in AI, and in particular in Knowledge Representation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
