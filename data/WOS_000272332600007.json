This behavior complicates the high-level simulation of such systems and it is the main reason for the lack of simulation tools devoted to asynchronous microarchitectures. In this paper we present a modeling method useful for this kind of systems that describes the variable computation delay of an asynchronous circuit by using probability distribution functions. This method is deployed in an architectural simulator of a 64-bit superscalar asynchronous microarchitecture where the computation delay of each one of the modules of the microarchitecture was characterized through a probability distribution function. The experimental results show that the asynchronous behavior is successfully modeled, and the architectural simulations of standard benchmarks is affordable in terms of wall-clock simulation time.
