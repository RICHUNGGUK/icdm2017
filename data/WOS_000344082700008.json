This is done by utilizing background illumination of the bubbly wake. Shadows of the bubbles, cast on a bright background, were collected by a high-speed video camera. For detecting bubble shadows, the image was segmented using an edge detection technique such as Canny algorithm. Then, a curvature profile method was employed to distinguish individual bubbles within a cluster of highly overlapping bubbles. The utilized algorithm was made to detect partly overlapping bubbles and reconstruct the missing parts. The movement of recognized individual bubbles was tracked on a two-dimensional plane within a flow volume. To suppress only high frequency background variations generated by out-of-focus bubbles, a Gaussian low-pass filter was applied in this study. To obtain quantitative results, the wake of a ventilated NACA0015 hydrofoil was next investigated by applying a shadowgraphy technique and the described bubble detection algorithm. Results regarding bubbles' appearance, their velocity, and void fraction are presented. It was found that most of the bubbles were shaped like a circle and with a radius of 0.22 mm and the bubble's velocity was dependent of its size. Local void fraction was further analyzed and a possible problem was discussed in the paper.", "paper_title": "Application of a shadow image velocimetry to a ventilated hydrofoil wake", "paper_id": "WOS:000344082700008"}
