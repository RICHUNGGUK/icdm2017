Conditions for the existence of these observers are given. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotical stability of fractional-order observer errors with the fractional order a satisfying 0 < alpha < 2 are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, where the fractional order a belongs to 1 <= alpha < 2 and 0 < alpha <= 1, respectively. A stability analysis of the fractional-order error system is made and it is shown that the fractional-order observers are as stable as their integer order counterpart and guarantee better convergence of the estimation error.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF UNKNOWN INPUT FRACTIONAL-ORDER OBSERVERS FOR FRACTIONAL-ORDER SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000325208900001"}
