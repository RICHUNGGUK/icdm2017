However, most of these real world applications face high levels of uncertainties that can affect the operations of such applications. Hence, the fuzzy set theory has been applied and showed great success in the recent past. In this paper, we aim at reviewing the fuzzy set oriented approaches for HMA, individuating how the fuzzy set may improve the HMA, envisaging and delineating the future perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, there is not found a single survey in the current literature that has discussed and reviewed fuzzy approaches towards the HMA. For ease of understanding, we conceptually classify the human motion into three broad levels: Low-Level (LoL), Mid-Level (MiL), and High-Level (HiL) HMA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
