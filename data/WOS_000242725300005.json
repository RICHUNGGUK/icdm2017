Primary attention is given to the existence of closed loops in these biopolymers. By way of illustration, some mathematical facts are established and biological interpretation thereof is proposed. The paper is addressed to biologists, chemists, physicists, and mathematicians that are engaged in interdisciplinary research on RNA and proteins.", "paper_title": "Using semigroups in modeling of genomic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000242725300005"}
