Our MACs are faster than the standard MAC modes such as CBC-MAC, and provably secure if the block cipher is pseudorandom and its component is a permutation with a small differential probability. Such a MAC scheme was recently proposed by one of authors, and we provide improvements about security and treading-off between speed and amount of preprocessing.", "paper_title": "Improved MACs from differentially-uniform permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000252020700031"}
