A GIS extension, RockFall Analyst (RA), which is capable of effectively handling large amounts of geospatial information relative to rockfall behaviors, has been developed in ArcGIS using ArcObjects and C#. The 3D rockfall model considers dynamic processes on a cell plane basis. It uses inputs of distributed parameters in terms of raster and polygon features created in GIS. Two major components are included in RA: particle-based rockfall process modeling and geostatistics-based rockfall raster modeling. Rockfall process simulation results, 3D rockfall trajectories and their velocity features either for point seeders or polyline seeders are stored in 3D shape files. Distributed raster modeling, based on 3D rockfall trajectories and a spatial geostatistical technique, represents the distribution of spatial frequency, the flying and/or bouncing height, and the kinetic energy of failing rocks. A distribution of rockfall hazard can be created by taking these rockfall characteristics into account. A barrier analysis tool is also provided in RA to aid barrier design. An application of these modeling techniques to a case study is provided. The RA has been tested in ArcGIS 8.2, 8.3, 9.0 and 9.1. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
