The idea is to consider a classic WCDMA zero-intermediate frequency (Zero-IF) transmitter with a modified Cartesian feedback (CFB) loop. The new transmitter architecture consists of an analog stage including forward I/Q modulator and feedback I/Q demodulator, and a digital stage adjusting the phase rotation around the loop. The whole system consumes 500 and 2.94 mW, respectively, for the analog and the digital part. System level simulation gave a maximum improvement of 35 dBc at 5 MHz from the carrier for the W-CDMA signal.", "paper_title": "Mixed Cartesian feedback for Zero-IF WCDMA transmitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400026"}
