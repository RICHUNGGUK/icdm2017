This research reveals 17 anxieties, grouped into 5 categories containing implementation anxieties of ambient intelligence in hospitals. The results expand the basis in theory underlying technology-related anxieties of medical professionals and offer theoretical and practical implications, leading to an initial basis for decisions regarding the implementation of ambient systems.", "paper_title": "Determining Anxieties in Relation to Ambient Intelligence-Explorative Findings from Hospital Settings", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714400005"}
