While current T2D medications are efficacious, significant side effects have limited their use and availability. Our laboratory has discovered that abscisic acid (ABA) exerts anti-diabetic effects, in part, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). However, since ABA does not bind to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPAR gamma, the mechanism of activation of PPAR gamma by ABA remains unknown. Lanthionine synthetase component C-like protein 2 (LANCL2) was predicted to be a novel target for the binding and signaling of ABA in human granulocytes and rat insulinoma cells. The goal of this study was to determine whether LANCL2 is a molecular target of ABA and other PPAR gamma agonists. To this end we performed homology modeling to construct a three-dimensional structure of LANCL2 using the crystal structure of LANCL1 as a template. Our molecular docking studies predicted that ABA and other PPAR gamma agonists (e.g., rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) share a binding site on the surface of LANCL2. The identification of a binding site for PPAR gamma agonists will facilitate the high-throughput virtual screening of large compound libraries and may shed new light on alternative mechanisms of PPAR gamma activation.", "paper_title": "Molecular modeling of lanthionine synthetase component C-like protein 2: a potential target for the discovery of novel type 2 diabetes prophylactics and therapeutics", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531200012"}
