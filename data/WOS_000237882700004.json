In this regard, realistic microstructures that could be validated against microscopic images of fruit tissues were generated. Microscopic images of tissues of different apple cultivars (Greenstar, Kanzi, Pinova and Cameo) were digitized using an image analysis software program. The geometrical cell structure was described by means of statistical distributions of the cell area, cell aspect ratio and cell orientation. The cell orientation and cell aspect ratio were calculated based on the moments of inertia (area moments) and least-square ellipse fitting, respectively. The statistical geometrical properties of different cultivars were compared. These quantitative descriptors were then used in conjunction with a Poisson Voronoi tessellation algorithm to produce virtual cell tissue with the same statistical properties as the real tissue. The geometrical models will be used in a multiscale modelling approach to investigate water and gas transport in fruits. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
