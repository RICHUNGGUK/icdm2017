However, because of lower transmission rates and the limitation of the distance through access networks, it is not possible to offer users satisfactory services. In order to solve the issue of limited transmission rates through access networks and to guarantee Quality-of-Service, we propose a differentiated bandwidth allocation method and a wavelength assignment method in Wavelength Division Multiplexing Ethernet Passive Optical Networks. The proposed methods are implemented using OPNET, and we have estimated the performance of the proposed methods. The results show that the proposed methods have outstanding performance and they can provide great parameters to model real access networks.", "paper_title": "Differentiated bandwidth allocation and wavelength assignment method in WDM EPON", "paper_id": "WOS:000311599000004"}
