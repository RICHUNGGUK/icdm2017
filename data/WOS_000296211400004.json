In particular, this leads to connections between Estrada Indices for sigma- and pi-bonded Mobius-twisted molecular frameworks, and implies that non-bipartite Mains graphs have a bipartivity index that exceeds the value of unity for bipartite graphs. As examples of Mobius cycles, ladders and polyacenes all illustrate, the effect of the half twist washes out rapidly, and the linear asymptotic limit of EE(G) is reached for small numbers of vertices.", "paper_title": "Mobius Systems and the Estrada Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000296211400004"}
