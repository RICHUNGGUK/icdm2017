This artificial neuron aims at incorporating an improved aggregation operation on the complex-valued signals. The aggregation operation is based on the idea underlying the weighted root-power mean of input signals. This aggregation operation allows modeling the degree of compensation in a natural manner and includes various aggregation operations as its special cases. The complex resilient propagation algorithm (C-RPROP) with error-dependent weight backtracking step accelerates the training speed significantly and provides better approximation accuracy. Finally, performance evaluation of the proposed complex root-power mean neuron with the C-RPROP learning algorithm on various typical examples is given to understand the motivation.", "paper_title": "On Efficient Learning Machine With Root-Power Mean Neuron in Complex Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000290414400005"}
