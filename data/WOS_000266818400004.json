In this article, we present a comparative study between a few fairly different such platforms, namely MANTIS, TinyOS, and ZigBee, when considering them from the application developer's perspective, that is, by focusing mostly on functional aspects, rather than on performance or code size. In other words, we compare both the tasking model used by these platforms and the API libraries they offer. Sensor network applications are basically event based, so most of the software platforms are also built on considering event handling mechanism, however some use a more traditional thread based model. In this article, we consider implementations of a simple generic application in MANTIS, TinyOS, and the Ember ZigBee development framework, with the goal of depicting major differences between these platforms, and suggesting a programming style aimed at maximizing portability between them.", "paper_title": "A Comparison of Software Platforms for Wireless Sensor Networks: MANTIS, TinyOS, and ZigBee", "paper_id": "WOS:000266818400004"}
