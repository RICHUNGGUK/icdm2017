This minimization problem, defined by Hallett and Lagergren (2001), is that of finding the most parsimonious lateral gene transfer scenario for a given pair of gene and species trees. Our main results are the following: (a) We show that it is not possible to approximate the problem in polynomial time within an approximation ratio of 1 + epsilon, for some constant epsilon > 0 unless P = NP. We also provide explicit values of epsilon for the above claim. (b) We provide an upper bound on the cost of any 1-active scenario and prove the tightness of this bound.", "paper_title": "Inapproximability results for the lateral gene transfer problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000237795700003"}
