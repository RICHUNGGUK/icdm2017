The two qubits are asymmetrically encoded by two four-level atoms coupled via a quantized cavity mode. Under proper conditions, the desirable logic operation can be implemented in one step. Since the qubit is encoded by the ground and the metastable states of the atom and the cavity mode is not really excited, our protocol is robust against the spontaneous decays of the atoms and cavity. Specifically, the feasibility of our generic proposal is demonstrated with two nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled to whispering-gallery microresonator.", "paper_title": "ONE-STEP IMPLEMENTATION OF QUANTUM CONTROLLED-PHASE GATE VIA QUANTUM ZENO DYNAMICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000333067900008"}
