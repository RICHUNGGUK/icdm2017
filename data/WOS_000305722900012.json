Clustering is an effective method to discover natural structures of data objects in data mining. Both clustering ensemble and semi-supervised clustering techniques have been emerged to improve the clustering performance of unsupervised clustering algorithms. Cop-Kmeans is a K-means variant that incorporates background knowledge in the form of pairwise constraints. However, there exists a constraint violation in Cop-Kmeans. This paper proposes an improved Cop-Kmeans (ICop-Kmeans) algorithm to solve the constraint violation of Cop-Kmeans. The certainty of objects is computed to obtain a better assignment order of objects by the weighted co-association. The paper proposes a new constrained self-organizing map (SOM) to combine multiple semi-supervised clustering solutions for further enhancing the performance of ICop-Kmeans. The proposed methods effectively improve the clustering results from the validated experiments and the quality of complex decisions in IDSS. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
