Eight different XC functionals are utilized to calculate the exchange-coupling constant J from both the full crystalline structures and model structures of smaller size. The comparison between theoretical values and accurate experimental results supports the applicability of DFT-BS method in this new type of sandwich-type dinuclear polyoxomolybdates. However, a careful choice of functionals is necessary to achieve the desired accuracy. The encouraging results obtained from calculations on model structures highlight the great potential of application of structure modeling in theoretical study of POM. Structural modeling may not only reduce the computational cost of large POM species but also be able to take into account the external field effect arising from solvent molecules in solution or counterions in crystal.", "paper_title": "Combined DFT and BS study on the exchange coupling of dinuclear sandwich-type POM: comparison of different functionals and reliability of structure modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000303541900053"}
