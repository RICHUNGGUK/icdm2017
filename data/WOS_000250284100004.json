The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model and the extension known as Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) model are widely used. The modelling of the adsorption phenomena in many chemical and industrial processes is proved to be of great interest. Consequently, a correct selection of the isotherm model and a correct estimation of the parameters are crucial tasks. The first objective to characterize the adsorption phenomena is to choose which of the models will best fit the data. T-optimum designs have been obtained in order to discriminate between both models. Once the model has been selected the correct estimation of the parameters is crucial. D- and c-optimality criteria are used in this work. Optimum designs are references, which allow the experimenter to measure the efficiency of any experimental design compared to the optimum.
