From the perspective of vertical integration of operational process in emergency management, emergency resources can be classified as those resources used during the response period as well as those resources that are consumed during the recovery period. An inter-temporal integrated single-period resource model for solving optimal order quantity is proposed that meets the characteristics during the demand for the recovery resources depending on the stock shortage of the response resources. In the light of the classification of the dependent relationship of the two kinds of resources, namely deterministic or stochastic, the research investigates the analytical properties of the model, based on which, a genetic algorithm-based simulation approach is proposed. Finally, a real case with numerical example is provided to assess and validate our model, as well as managerial insights are obtained through key parameters sensitivity analysis.
