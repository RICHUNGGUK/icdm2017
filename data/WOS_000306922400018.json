Also, many multipliers based on the Karatsuba-Ofman algorithm (KOA) was proposed that sacrificed time efficiency for low space complexity. In this paper, a new multiplication formula which is a variant of KOA presented. We also provide a straightforward architecture of a non-pipelined bit-parallel multiplier using the new formula. The proposed multiplier has lower space complexity than and comparable time complexity to previous Mastrovito multipliers' for all irreducible trinomials.", "paper_title": "New Bit Parallel Multiplier With Low Space Complexity for All Irreducible Trinomials Over GF(2(n))", "paper_id": "WOS:000306922400018"}
