The introduction of the SIP protocol realizes the expectation. Following the cost saving spirit of VoIP, we focus on studying inexpensive high availability solutions for the SIP-based VoIP Service. In this paper, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based and DN-LB based schemes are mainly compared in the paper. A P2P-based scheme enables an inexpensive high availability solution to the VoIP service by the shared computation resources form P2P nodes. Such a P2P-based solution may be appropriate for an individual VoIP user. However, a caller may take a large volume of messages to find out a callee via the proxy nodes in the P2P network. This inherent property of a P2P network may induce the message overhead and long call setup delay. Based on above, another inexpensive scheme, which is a probing-based name resolution solution, is proposed to achieve high availability and load balancing for the VoIP service. We tag the probing mechanism onto the open source project Domain Name Relay Daemon (DNRD) to become a domain name resolution based load balancer (DN-LB). With DN-LB, all request messages from clients can be fairly distributed to all failure-proof proxy servers in the server farm without using any additional costly intermediate network device and changing the standard SIP architecture. Such a DN-LB based solution may be a good choice for a VoIP service provider.", "paper_title": "Inexpensive high availability solutions for the SIP-based VoIP service", "paper_id": "WOS:000289214700013"}
