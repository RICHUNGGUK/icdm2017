Chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) with simulated annealing algorithm (SACPSO) is proposed to choose the parameters of LS-SVM automatically. CPSO adopts chaotic mapping with certainty, ergodicity and the stochastic property, possessing high search efficiency. SA algorithm employs certain probability to improve the ability of PSO to escape from a local optimum. The results show that the proposed approach has a better generalization performance and is more effective than LS-SVM based on particle swarm optimization.", "paper_title": "LS-SVM based on chaotic particle swarm optimization with simulated annealing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800009"}
