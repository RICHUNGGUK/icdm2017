Therefore, there have recently been many studies of changing the spectrum management framework based on market mechanisms. This research analyses three different mechanisms as alternative secondary trading frameworks: a brokerage mechanism, auction and direct trading, and suggests an optimal framework for secondary-use trading based on in-depth simulations that consider different attributes according to their technical characteristics and market changes. Based on the analysis, this study investigates economic values and competition environments of each alternative for secondary trading mechanisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
