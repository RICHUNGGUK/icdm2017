The Intelligent Assistive Technology and Systems Lab (IATSL) and their collaborators are a team of engineers, computer scientists, and rehabilitation specialists who have been working with end users to develop devices and systems for supporting people in home and institutional environments for over a decade. This paper presents key themes for supporting the development of health-centric intelligent environments and systems. Examples of the themes are illustrated through several case studies of real-world applications developed through IATSL's research. The paper concludes by highlighting some areas that need to be considered by the field as intelligent environments move out of the research lab and into people's homes.", "paper_title": "Themes identified and lessons learned through the development of intelligent environments that support healthy well-being", "paper_id": "WOS:000332888200007"}
