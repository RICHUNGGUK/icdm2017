Conventional tests are sensitive to location difference among distributions, but are dull to detect the variation in shape. The new tests are sensitive to both location and shape. In fact, if the distributions of k-sampled populations are different in location only, the new tests are as powerful as the old ones. Otherwise, they are much more powerful. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
