However, most of existing privacy-preserving aggregation schemes are only focused on the summation aggregation. In this paper, based on the lattice cryptographic technique, we propose a novel privacy-preserving dual-functional aggregation scheme (PDA) for smart grid communications. With our proposed PDA scheme, each individual user just reports one data, then multiple statistic values, that is, mean and variance, of all users can be computed by the data & control center in the smart grid, while the privacy of each individual user can still be protected. Detailed security analyses demonstrate that our proposed PDA scheme is secure and robust. In addition, extensive performance evaluations also show that our proposed PDA scheme is efficient in terms of computational and communication overheads when the number of considered users is within an acceptable range.
