The insertion of the digital communication network inevitably leads to packet dropout, time delay and quantisation error. Due to data rate limitations, quantisation error is not neglected. In particular, the case where the sensors and controllers are geographically separated and connected via noisy, bandwidth-limited digital communication channels is considered. A fundamental limitation on the data rate of the channel for mean-square stabilisation of the closed-loop system is established. Sufficient conditions for mean-square stabilisation are derived. It is shown that there exists a quantisation, coding and control scheme to stabilise the unstable system over packet dropout communication channels if the data rate is larger than the lower bound proposed in our result. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions.", "paper_title": "Networked control of discrete-time linear systems over lossy digital communication channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000320191500013"}
