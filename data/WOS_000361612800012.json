The probability of lot acceptance is derived based on the exact sampling distribution and two-point condition on operating characteristic curve is used to determine the plan parameters that meet both the producer's and consumer's quality and risk requirements. Moreover, the performance of the proposed variables resubmitted sampling plan is investigated and compared with the classical variables single sampling plan. The results indicate that the developed resubmitted sampling plan can provide the same protection with less inspection when the submitted lot is good enough. Tables of the plan parameters under various conditions are provided and the use of the proposed plan is also illustrated with an example.", "paper_title": "A flexible sampling scheme for variables inspection with loss consideration", "paper_id": "WOS:000361612800012"}
