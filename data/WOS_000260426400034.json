In this correspondence, we derive performance bounds for this problem for each of three decode-and-forward protocols. The first protocol is a two phase protocol where both users simultaneously transmit during the first phase and the relay alone transmits during the second. In this protocol, our bounds are tight. The second protocol considers sequential transmissions from the two users followed by a transmission from the relay while the third protocol is a hybrid of the first two protocols and has four phases. In the latter two protocols the bounds are no identical. Numerical evaluation shows that in some cases of interest our bounds do not differ significantly. Finally, in the Gaussian case with path loss, we derive achievable rates and compare the relative merits of each protocol. This case is of interest in cellular systems. Surprisingly, we find that in some cases, the achievable rate region of the four phase protocol contains points that are outside the outer bounds of the (other two protocols.", "paper_title": "Performance Bounds for Bidirectional Coded Cooperation Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000260426400034"}
