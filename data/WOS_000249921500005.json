The final objective can be stated in terms of a classification of isolated pixels between classes, which can be either previously known or not (for example, different land uses), but with no particular shape nither well defined borders. Hence, a fuzzy approach seems natural in order to capture the structure of the image. In this paper we stress that some useful tools for a fuzzy classification can be derived from fuzzy coloring procedures, to be extended in a second stage to the complete non visible spectrum. In fact, the image is considered here as a fuzzy graph defined on the set of pixels, taking advantage of fuzzy numbers in order to summarize information. A fuzzy model is then presented, to be considered as a decision making aid tool. In this way we generalize the classical definition of fuzzy partition due to Ruspini, allowing in addition a first evaluation of the quality of the classification in this way obtained, in terms of three basic indexes (measuring covering, relevance and overlapping of our family of classes).", "paper_title": "Fuzzy sets in remote sensing classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000249921500005"}
