In this paper, we first present a general statement regarding the concept of Shikakeology as the science of shikake. The mechanism behind a shikake covers a wide range of physical and psychological triggers. From a shikake perspective, physical triggers are used to ignite psychological triggers, and psychological triggers work as driving forces for changing behavior. We use a case study approach to explain the shikake mechanism. We describe five simple cases to explain the concept of shikake as well as their trigger mechanisms. We then present shikake trigger categories, which are used to systematically describe shikake triggers. To date, we have annotated 120 shikake cases according to these categories. To explore rules of thumb for the shikake triggers, we finally present the statistics as a shikake trigger matrix to represent patterns of triggers frequently used together.", "paper_title": "Shikakeology: designing triggers for behavior change", "paper_id": "WOS:000365105300002"}
