This RT-MPC has its simplicity in parallelism to model predictive control design and efficiency to deal with computational complexity. First, a SORBFNN with concurrent structure and parameter learning is developed as the predictive model of the nonlinear systems. The model performance can be significantly improved through SORBFNN, and the modeling error is uniformly ultimately bounded. Second, a fast gradient method (GM) is enhanced for the solution of optimal control problem. This proposed GM can reduce computational cost and suboptimize the RT-MPC online. Then, the conditions of the stability analysis and steady-state performance of the closed-loop systems are presented. Finally, numerical simulations reveal that the proposed control gives satisfactory tracking and disturbance rejection performances. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Model Predictive Control Using a Self-Organizing Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000325980900007"}
