To address the weaknesses of these existing algorithms, we propose a novel distributed MCDS approximation algorithm, CDS-HG, to construct the connected dominating set (CDS) for WSNs. This algorithm models a WSN as a hierarchical graph and uses a competition-based strategy to select nodes Lit a certain hierarchical level to route messages for nodes in the next level of the hierarchical graph. Formal analysis and simulation studies show that our CDS-HG algorithm generates smaller CDS sizes while requiring less communication overhead compared with the existing distributed MCDS approximation algorithms.
