Jobs arrive one by one over list. When a new job arrives at most K already scheduled jobs can be removed from the schedule, then all removed jobs and the new job must be assigned to the machines. The problem is a relaxation of the similar problem online scheduling with a buffer [4]. Assume machine M(1) has speed 1 and M(2) has speed s >= 1. With respect to the worst case ratio, we obtain that (i) for s >= root 3 or K >= 2, the model of online scheduling with bounded rearrangement is equivalent to the model of online scheduling with a bounded buffer; (ii) the model of online scheduling with bounded rearrangement is more powerful than the model of online scheduling with a bounded buffer for root 2 <= s < root 3 and K = 1; (iii) except for 1.3247 <= s < root 3 and K = 1 there is an optimal algorithm for the online scheduling with bounded rearrangement; (iv) fors > 1.618 the lower bound is improved.
