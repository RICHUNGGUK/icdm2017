Among the surface features, paper formation, i.e., the level of homogeneity in the distribution of fibres on the surface of paper, is a key quality parameter, being currently monitored off-line, at low sampling rates relatively to the high production speeds achieved with modern paper machines. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem of assessing the quality of paper formation, on-line, in situ, in an autonomous, efficient, objective and fast way, using features derived from images collected by a specially designed sensor, coupled with proper classification methodologies. The results obtained clearly demonstrate the potential of the proposed assessment approach either for the more complex three-class classification problem as well as for less demanding, but still important in practice, two-class \"Accept\"/\"Reject\" or \"Pass\"/\"Fail\" problem.
