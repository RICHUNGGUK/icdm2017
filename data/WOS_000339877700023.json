Unfortunately, several problems hinder the widespread acceptance of mobile payments, for example, privacy protection and user anonymity. Measures to ensure anonymity in payment systems must be considered as an important factor in privacy and system acceptance. We propose a new measure to enhance the level of anonymity in mobile payments where users can customize their anonymity, according to their personal preferences. We rely on IPAS (Implicit Password Authentication System) (Almuairfi et al. 2011) for dispute resolution to support our proposed idea.", "paper_title": "Anonymous proximity mobile payment (APMP)", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700023"}
