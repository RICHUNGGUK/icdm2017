The model's exogenous input is injected current, and whenever the membrane potential output exceeds a specified threshold, it is fed back as a second input. The PDMs are estimated from the previously developed Nonlinear Autoregressive Volterra (NARV) model, and represent an efficient functional basis for Volterra kernel expansion. The PDM-based model admits a modular representation, consisting of the forward and feedback PDM bases as linear filterbanks for the exogenous and autoregressive inputs, respectively, whose outputs are then fed to a static nonlinearity composed of polynomials operating on the PDM outputs and cross-terms of pair-products of PDM outputs. A two-step procedure for model reduction is performed: first, influential subsets of the forward and feedback PDM bases are identified and selected as the reduced PDM bases. Second, the terms of the static nonlinearity are pruned. The first step reduces model complexity from a total of 65 coefficients to 27, while the second further reduces the model coefficients to only eight. It is demonstrated that the performance cost of model reduction in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy is minimal. Unlike the full model, the eight coefficient pruned model can be easily visualized to reveal the essential system components, and thus the data-derived PDM model can yield insight into the underlying system structure and function.", "paper_title": "Principal Dynamic Mode Analysis of the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000349847800001"}
