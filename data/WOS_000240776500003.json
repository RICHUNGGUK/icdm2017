Such problems, proposed by Campbell, have a number of diverse applications. Several cost functions are shown here to yield quasiarithmetic problems with simple redundancy bounds in terms of a generalized entropy. A related property, also shown here, involves the existence of optimal codes: For \"well-behaved\" cost functions, optimal codes always exist for (possibly infinite-alphabet) sources having finite generalized entropy. An algorithm is introduced for finding binary codes optimal for convex cost functions. This algorithm, which can be extended to other minimization utilities, can be performed using quadratic time and linear space. This reduces the computational complexity of a problem involving minimum delay in a queue, allows combinations of previously considered problems to be optimized, and greatly expands the set of problems solvable in quadratic time and linear space.", "paper_title": "Source coding for quasiarithmetic penalties", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500003"}
