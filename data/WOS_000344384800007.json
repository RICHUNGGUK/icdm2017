First, based on ordered ranked set sampling (ORSS) introduced by Balakrishnan and Li [Ordered ranked set samples and applications to inference. Ann Inst Statist Math. 2006;58:757-777], we obtain prediction intervals for order statistics from a future sample and compare the results with the one based on the usual-order statistics. Next, we construct prediction intervals for record values from a future sequence based on ORSS and compare the results with the one based on an another independent record sequence developed recently by Ahmadi and Balakrishnan [Prediction of order statistics and record values from two independent sequences.
