The paper describes ad hoc grid resource discovery, ad hoc grid service subscription and ad hoc grid resource access. The ad hoc grid resource discovery provides a mechanism to discover ad hoc grid resources for grid user agents. Ad hoc grid resource access is used for grid user agents to obtain and access the located resource. Ad hoc grid service subscription is responsible for ad hoc grid service detection and subscription, and allows grid user agents to dynamically subscribe some services.", "paper_title": "Integration of economics mechanism and mobile agent in ad hoc grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000287019600002"}
