The advantage of the atomistic approach is that the detailed level of description allows complete freedom in specifying the swimmer design and its coupling with the surrounding fluid. A series of swimmers employing a variety of propulsion mechanisms motivated by biological and microrobotic designs is investigated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
