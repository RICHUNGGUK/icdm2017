It is the enforcement of constraints that any input must satisfy before it is accepted to raise external effects. We have discovered some empirical properties for characterizing input validation in Web applications. In this paper, we propose an approach for automated recovery of input validation model from program source code. The model recovered is represented in a variant of control flow graph, called validation flow graph, which shows essential input validation features implemented in programs. Based on the model, we then formulate two coverage criteria for testing input validation. The two criteria can be used to guide the structural testing of input validation in Web applications. We have evaluated the proposed approach through case studies and experiments.
