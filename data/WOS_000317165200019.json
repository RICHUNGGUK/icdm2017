Previous relevant literature focuses on performing an optimized assignment of manuscripts (or proposals) to reviewers. In this paper, we study a group-to-group reviewer assignment problem, where manuscripts and reviewers are divided into groups, with groups of reviewers are assigned to groups of manuscripts. We formulate this problem as a multi-objective mixed integer programming model, which is proven NP-hard. An effective two-phase stochastic-biased greedy algorithm is then proposed to solve the problem. Results of comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. The approach is applied to a real application, for which the result receive positive and encouraging feedback from users. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
