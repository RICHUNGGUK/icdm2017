A new acceptance rule that based on the principle of minimal free energy from the statistical mechanics is introduced to the standard particle swarm optimizer. A definition of the entropy of the particle system is given. Then the law of entropy increment is applied to control the algorithm. Simulations have been done to illustrate the significant and effective impact of this new rule on the particle swarm optimizer.", "paper_title": "A new dynamic particle swarm optimizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300061"}
