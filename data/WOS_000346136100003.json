One such opportunity is in vehicular traffic monitoring, whereby sampling of Bluetooth radios serve as proxies for vehicles and consequently for traffic density and flow. This paper discusses a complete data collection system developed at the University of Manitoba that utilizes a variety of wireless networking technologies and devices to collect inferred traffic data at an intersection along a major thoroughfare in an urban setting. Specifically, a wireless sensor network of slave probes was designed and implemented with the objective to collect Bluetooth device information for this purpose. To facilitate easy setup and a long battery life, a solar-powered probe design was investigated. Data from each slave probe is communicated to a master node through XBee communication, where it is stored on a secure digital (SD) memory card before being transmitted to a central server every five minutes over a global system for mobile communications (GSM) cellular network. The server parses the data received and stores it in a database. Consumer and corporate websites may then access this database to display archived data or current data in real-time to various users.", "paper_title": "Vehicular Traffic Monitoring Using Bluetooth Scanning Over a Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000346136100003"}
