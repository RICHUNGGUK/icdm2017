The considered strategies differ in the time when retransmissions for one particular node are carried out, and in the number of retransmissions that can be carried out for one node. We show experimentally and by simulation that two related strategies introduced in this paper, called the queueing-based strategies, significantly outperform the traditional strategy (in which all admissible trials towards one node are carried out subsequently) in terms of the average number of nodes that cannot be successfully served in a cycle. These performance gains are achieved without increasing the average total transmission effort.", "paper_title": "Retransmission Strategies for Cyclic Polling Over Wireless Channels in the Presence of Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000284008200015"}
