Credibility-based voting with spot-checking is a promising approach to the high-performance and reliable VC systems. In this approach, spot-check rate has a significant impact on the performance, which must be set before the computation. Therefore, the estimation of the optimal spot-check rate is the major concern to minimize the computation time. The key idea for the estimation is to represent the mathematical expectation of the computation time as a function of spot-check rate. Extensive simulation has shown that the proposed technique always obtains an approximate estimate of the optimal spot-check rate and minimizes the computation time with an uncertainty of 1%.", "paper_title": "Optimal Spot-checking for Computation Time Minimization in Volunteer Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000272245700010"}
