The molten glass is modeled by an incompressible Newtonian liquid undergoing flow. Then a three-dimensional finite element method is used to perform the simulations of the fluid and heat flow. The simulation employs an equal-order velocity-pressure interpolation method. The relation between velocity and pressure is obtained from the discretized momentum equations in order to derive the pressure equation. The glass simulation is coupled with the mold temperature simulation by matching the temperature and heat flux on the glass-mold interface.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional numerical simulation of the pressing process in TV panel production", "paper_id": "WOS:000238649900004"}
