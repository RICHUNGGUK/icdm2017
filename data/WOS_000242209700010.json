Emerging from this domain is support for consumers \"on the go,\" when they are actually inside a retail store. This paper introduces a \"product attractiveness cue\" as a way of delivering decision support in this context. The paper also provides an experiment to examine the effectiveness of these cues in a laboratory environment. On the basis of these results (N=86), the attractiveness cue was shown effective in improving the consideration set quality of the participants. This effect was stable across treatments with 10 and 20 products. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
