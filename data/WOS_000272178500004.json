By a simple change of variables and using the first order Plya-Szego polarization tensor, we obtain a closed formula for the topological sensitivity. For the sake of completeness, the analytical expression for the topological derivative is checked numerically using the standard Finite Element Method. Finally, we present two numerical experiments showing the influency of the orthotropy in the topological derivative field and also one example concerning the optimal design of a heat conductor.", "paper_title": "Topological derivative for steady-state orthotropic heat diffusion problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500004"}
