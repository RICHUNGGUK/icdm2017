When multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, their signals collide, increasing the identification delay. Therefore, many previous anti-collision algorithms, including an adaptive query splitting algorithm (AQS) and an adaptive binary splitting algorithm (ABS), focused on solving this problem. This paper proposes two blocking algorithms, a single resolution blocking ABS algorithm (SRB) and a pair resolution blocking ABS algorithm (PRB), based on ABS. SRB not only inherits the essence of ABS which uses the information of recognized tags obtained from the last process of tag identification, but also adopts a blocking technique which prevents recognized tags from being collided by unrecognized tags. PRB further adopts a pair resolution technique which couples recognized tags and thus only needs half time for next identifying these recognized tags. We formally analyze the performance of SRB and PRB. Finally, the analytic and simulation results show that SRB slightly outperforms ABS and PRB significantly surpasses ABS.", "paper_title": "Two Blocking Algorithms on Adaptive Binary Splitting: Single and Pair Resolutions for RFID Tag Identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000267379400022"}
