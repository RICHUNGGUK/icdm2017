The method consists of an iterative algorithm to search and apply a sequence of bilateral power exchanges among the generators that would optimally reduce and completely remove the congestions. A combination of fuzzy decision principle and sensitivity analysis is developed to choose the best exchange and AC load flow is used to apply it on the network in the iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated in a case study on IEEE 118-bus system, and results are discussed in the paper in comparison with the mathematical and evolutionary-based optimization techniques.", "paper_title": "A heuristic fuzzy decision-based solving of redispatching problem for congestion management in restructured power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316113700014"}
