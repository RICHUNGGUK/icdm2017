In this article, we propose a novel bio-inspired protocol: EraMobile (Epidemic-based Reliable and Adaptive Multicast for Mobile ad hoc networks). We also present extensive performance analysis results for it. EraMobile supports group applications that require high reliability. The protocol aims to deliver multicast data reliably with minimal network overhead, even under adverse network conditions. With an epidemic-based multicast method, it copes with dynamic and unpredictable topology changes due to mobility. Our epidemic mechanism does not require maintaining any tree- or mesh-like structure for multicasting. It requires neither a global nor a partial view of the network, nor does it require information about neighboring nodes and group members. In addition, it substantially lowers overhead by eliminating redundant data transmissions. Another distinguishing feature is its ability to adapt to varying node densities. This lets it deliver data reliably in both sparse networks (where network connectivity is prone to interruptions) and dense networks (where congestion is likely). We describe the working principles of the protocol and study its performance through comparative and extensive simulations in the ns-2 network simulator. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
