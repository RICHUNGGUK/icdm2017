In this paper we investigate applications of the linear matroid parity algorithm to the Steiner tree problem for two classes of graphs: where the terminals form a vertex cover and where terminals form a dominating set. As all these problems are MAX-SNP-hard, the issue is what approximation can be obtained in polynomial time. The previously best approximation ratio for the first class of graphs (also known as unweighted quasi-bipartite graphs) is approximate to 1.217 (Gropl et al. [4]) is reduced in this paper to 8/7 - 1/160 approximate to 1.137. For the case of graphs where terminals form a dominating set, an approximation ratio of 4/3 is achieved.", "paper_title": "Applications of the linear matroid parity algorithm to approximating Steiner trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200010"}
