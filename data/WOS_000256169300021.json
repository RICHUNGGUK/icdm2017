At present, it contains information on m/z ratio to protein links that were extracted from 120 published research papers. It has a web interface that allows researchers to query and retrieve putative proteins that correspond to a user-specified m/z ratio. EPO-KB also allows automated entry of additional m/z ratio to protein links and is expandable to the addition of gene to protein and protein to disease links.", "paper_title": "EPO-KB: a searchable knowledge base of biomarker to protein links", "paper_id": "WOS:000256169300021"}
