Within the cloud system, medical data can be collected and transmitted automatically to medical professionals from anywhere and feedback can be returned to patients through the network. In this article, we developed a cloud-based system for clients with mobile devices or web browsers. Specially, we aim to address the issues regarding the usefulness of the ECG data collected from patients themselves. Algorithms for ECG enhancement, ECG quality evaluation and ECG parameters extraction were implemented in the system. The system was demonstrated by a use case, in which ECG data was uploaded to the web server from a mobile phone at a certain frequency and analysis was performed in real time using the server. The system has been proven to be functional, accurate and efficient. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
