The input flow is described by a Markov Arrival Process. If an arriving customer meets the server providing the service, it goes to the orbit and repeats attempts to get service in random time intervals whose duration has exponential distribution with parameter dependent on the customers number in orbit. Server operates as follows. After a service completion epoch, customers admission interval starts. Duration of this interval has phase type distribution. During this interval, primary customers and customers from the orbit are accepted to the pool of customers which will get service after the admission interval. Capacity of this pool is limited and after the moment when the pool becomes full before completion of admission interval all arriving customers move to the orbit. After completion of an admission interval, all customers in the pool are served simultaneously by the server during the time having phase type distribution depending on the customers number in the pool. Using results known for Asymptotically Quasi-Toeplitz Markov Chains, we derive stability condition of the system, compute the stationary distribution of the system states, derive formulas for the main performance measures and numerically show advantages of the considered customer's admission discipline (higher throughput, smaller average number of customers in the system, higher probability to get a service without visiting the orbit) in case of proper choice of the capacity of the pool and the admission period duration.
