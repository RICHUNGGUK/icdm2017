These lower bounds are used in conjunction with an upper bound to eliminate nodes and edges. However, for each node and edge, a Lagrangean dual problem exists whose solution may differ from the relaxation of the full problem. Thus, using one Lagrange multiplier does not offer the best possible network reduction. Furthermore, eliminating nodes and edges from the network may change the Lagrangean dual solutions in the remaining reduced network, warranting an iterative solution and reduction procedure. We develop a method for solving the related Lagrangean dual problems for each edge simultaneously which is iterated with eliminating nodes and edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method computationally: we test it against several others and show that it both reduces solve time and the number of intractable problems encountered. We use a modified version of Carlyle and Wood's (38th Annual ORSNZ Conference, Hamilton, New Zealand, November, 2003) enumeration algorithm in the gap closing stage. We also make improvements to this algorithm and test them computationally. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
