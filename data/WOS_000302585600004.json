For a cloud user, he/she can request multiple cloud services simultaneously. In this case, parallel processing in the cloud system can improve the performance. When applying parallel processing in cloud computing, it is necessary to implement a mechanism to allocate resource and schedule the execution order of tasks. Furthermore, a resource optimization mechanism with preemptable task execution can increase the utilization of clouds. In this paper, we propose two online dynamic resource allocation algorithms for the IaaS cloud system with preemptable tasks. Our algorithms adjust the resource allocation dynamically based on the updated information of the actual task executions. And the experimental results show that our algorithms can significantly improve the performance in the situation where resource contention is fierce. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
