Afterwards, the yoking proof was developed into the grouping proof protocol and many such protocols have been presented. However there are some flaws on security or computational overhead. Based on the existing grouping proof protocols, a new method on key distribution is developed in this paper by means of distributing the points on straight lines to the entities. With this method, the performance of the grouping proof protocol will be improved. In comparison with the previous protocols, it provides security enhancement and performance improvement, which balances security and computational overhead to some extent.", "paper_title": "A High-security RFID Grouping Proof Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000005"}
