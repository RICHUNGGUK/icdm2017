But for long running queries, the messages communicated in pipelined architecture are even less than the normal count of messages in any query processing methodology in sensor networks, as also pointed out in previous work. In this paper we device a novel methodology to process aggregation queries in sensor networks by using the systolic architecture. We explicitly define and stipulate the use of systolic message communication as aggregation query processing technique to yield increased response time with the saving of energy by reduced message communication when considering long running queries. We show through simulation the two-fold gain using the proposed technique as compared to methods without pipelining.", "paper_title": "Systolic query processing for aggregation in sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600055"}
