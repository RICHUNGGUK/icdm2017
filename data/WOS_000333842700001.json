In this paper, we firstly propose a new Cover Sets Balance (CSB) algorithm to choose a set of active nodes with the partially ordered tuple (data coverage range, residual energy). Then, we introduce a new Correlated Node Set Computing (CNSC) algorithm to find the correlated node set for a given node. Finally, we propose a High Residual Energy First (HREF) node selection algorithm to further reduce the number of active nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HREF significantly reduces the number of active nodes, and CSB and HREF effectively increase the lifetime of wireless sensor networks compared with related works.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Node Selection Algorithms with Correlation Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333842700001"}
