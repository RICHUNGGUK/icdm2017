Roads appear as lines and arcs in roadway design software. Their visualization with colors can help achieve better natural understanding of road geometries. However, road visualization is such a time-consuming process that it has not been conducted on the regular basis in the practice of roadway design. The software solution described in this article can automatically visualize roadway designs, based on Computer Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) design standards. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
