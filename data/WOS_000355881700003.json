We say that a sequence has a competitive ratio of k, if the cost of serving the first customers in the sequence is at most k times the optimal solution for serving any customers for all possible values of . We provide an incremental framework that computes a sequence with a competitive ratio of at most eight and a worst-case instance that provides a lower bound of three for any incremental sequence. We also present the results of our computational experiments carried out on a set of benchmark instances for the UFLP. The problem has applications in multistage network planning.
