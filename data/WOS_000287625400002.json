The cricket Phaeophilacris spectrum uses air vortices as a form of short-range communication. This project aims to mimic this communication technique for use in robotic systems and to assess its capabilities in terms of technical requirements, range and the data it can provide. The design of an air vortex generator and receiver are described. Results of practical experiments to code information into sequences of vortices as well as to determine range of the source and direction of arrival are also presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
