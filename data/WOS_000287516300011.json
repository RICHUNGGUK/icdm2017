A trust model with five trust factors is constructed. The model is tested using data gathered from 295 practitioners. Confirmatory factor analysis is used to validate the model, and structural equation modelling is used for data analysis. The adoption of IIOS is influenced by trust factors including usability, reliability and availability, audit and verification mechanisms, and interoperability, while security is insignificant in this case. The generalization of the findings is currently limited, as the subjects were all Chinese people living in Hong Kong. Future studies could study individuals belonging to other types of professions, industries, and cultures to test the generalizability of the model. The study provides a trust model to facilitate practitioners for the effective adoption of IIOS. It also adds a trust model to the literature of IIOS in the electronic supply chain context.
