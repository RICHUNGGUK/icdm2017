The classical relation-based Pawlak rough set theory has been extended to covering-based generalized rough set theory. The rough set axiom system is the foundation of the covering-based generalized rough set theory, because the axiomatic characterizations of covering-based approximation operators guarantee the existence of coverings reproducing the operators. In this paper, the equivalent characterizations for the independent axiom sets of four types of covering-based generalized rough sets are investigated, and more refined axiom sets are presented.
