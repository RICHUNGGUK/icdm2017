The implementation of these models in PSAT is approached using a general methodology, which is described in detail. To evaluate the performances of the developed hydro turbine and governor models, simulation studies are carried out on test systems of different scales, from a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system to a larger system which includes 20 generators. Further more, transient stability analysis and small signal stability analysis are carried out to assess the performance of the implemented models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
