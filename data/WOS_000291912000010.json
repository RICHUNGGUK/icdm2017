Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies personal construct theory and the associated repertory grid to a mixed method study involving 15 repertory grid interviews, conducted with librarianship Master's students at a UK university. Findings - The findings regarding the perceived profile of the reader were similar to those reported in previous sociological research, but new constructs emerged regarding certain perceived characteristics of both readers and genres. Research limitations/implications - The method and findings provide a starting-point for future research in materials portraying, and originating from, minority ethnic communities. With more repeated constructs and a larger sample size, future research could statistically investigate the significance of potential trends and apparent relationships between data. Practical implications - The paper provides new data regarding the nature and readership of minority ethnic fiction, informing the improvement of its provision and promotion by public libraries. Social implications - It is hoped that longer-term effects will be to increase both public and professional understanding of fiction written by members of minority ethnic communities, and of its potential contribution to the wider body of literature in the English language. Originality/value - The paper applies personal construct theory and the associated repertory grid technique to a new area of research and practice, with new data having been generated concerning the perceived characteristics of fiction genres, and of their readers.", "paper_title": "Investigating fiction reader characteristics using personal construct theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000291912000010"}
