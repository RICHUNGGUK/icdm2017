However, we found that most traditional GRA methods only consider nonweighted similarity for predicting software development effort. In fact, nonweighted similarity may cause biased predictions, because each feature of a project may have a different degree of relevance to the development effort. Therefore, this paper proposes six weighted methods, including nonweighted, distance-based, correlative, linear, nonlinear, and maximal weights, to be integrated into GRA for software effort estimation. Numerical examples and sensitivity analyses based on four public datasets are used to show the performance of the proposed methods. The experimental results indicate that the weighted GRA can improve estimation accuracy and reliability from the nonweighted GRA. The results also demonstrate that the weighted GRA performs better than other estimation techniques and published results. In summary, we can conclude that weighted GRA can be a viable and alternative method for predicting software development effort.", "paper_title": "Comparison of weighted grey relational analysis for software effort estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000286465500008"}
