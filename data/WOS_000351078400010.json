Approximate solutions of frictionless flows are obtained considering a suitable formulation of the conservation laws, involving the water free surface and some fractions of water, accounting for the topography variations. The discretization of the friction source terms relies on the use of a modified Riemann solver for the flux computation. The resulting scheme is then corrected in order to achieve an asymptotic regime preservation. A MUSCL reconstruction is also performed to increase the space order of accuracy. The overall numerical approach is shown to be consistent, well-balanced and to satisfy a domain invariant principle. These results are assessed through several benchmark tests, involving complex geometry and varying bathymetry. In the presence of dry areas, special interest is given to the wave front speed computation, highlighting the stability of the method, even when implementing the asymptotic preserving correction.
