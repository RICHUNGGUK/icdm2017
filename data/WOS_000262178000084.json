To verify the proposed procedure, the actual DSL (digital Subscriber line) data in Taiwan is illustrated, and this study evaluates the accuracy of the proposed procedure by comparing with different innovation diffusion models: Bass model, Logistic model and Dynamic model. The results show that the proposed procedure Surpasses the methods listed in terms of accuracy and SSE (Sum of Squares Error). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
