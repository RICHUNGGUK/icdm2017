Although a number of individuals and companies have developed a presence (lands) in Second Life, there is no appropriate methodology in place for undertaking such developments. While some existing methods have been adapted by users to their individual needs, this paper explores the development of a method for developing lands specifically within Second Life. This method is based on case-based reasoning (CBR) as this method has a number of similarities with Second Life itself. A system was designed based on CBR with some modifications to work in accordance with Second Life. In this paper, the system and its modifications are discussed and its application to the development of space within Second Life is evaluated. From tracking its progress against previous specifications and future activity, an updated version of the CBR web tool component covering the latest changes and improvements in the tool is introduced here.", "paper_title": "Artefact generation in second life with case-based reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000288552500009"}
