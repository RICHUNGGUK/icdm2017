Two simple methods are formulated to calculate current carrying states using a low-dimensional device Hamiltonian in the scattering basis representation. The proposed methods are computationally very cheap and their utility is confirmed by test self-consistent calculations in a p-Si nanowire device. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
