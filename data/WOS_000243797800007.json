This paper deals with the application of expert system technology in order to use the experimental data for optimization of milling parameters so as to achieve targets of enhancing tool life and improving workpiece surface finish. Hard-milling experiments were conducted to study the effects of workpiece material hardness, cutter's helix angle, milling orientation and coolant upon tool life, workpiece surface roughness, and cutting forces. The experimental data were converted to useful information using ANOVA and numeric optimization, and this information was used to develop the knowledge-base in form of IF-THEN rules. Expert system utilized fuzzy logic for its reasoning mechanism, while, fuzzy data sets and crisp sets were freely mixed in antecedents and consequents of the rules. Effectiveness of the expert system was based upon two modules, namely optimization module and prediction module, with each of them operating upon different set of rules. Optimization module provides the optimal selection and combination of aforementioned milling parameters according to the desired objective, while the prediction module provides the prediction of performance measures for the combination of parameters finalized by the optimization module.
