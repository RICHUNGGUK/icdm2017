The utilization of the model is also exemplified with different setups In particular. the model was used to study the evolution of magnetically affected gram growth in samples with randomly oriented grains and the effect of the finite mobility of the boundary junctions on boundary migration These examples emphasize the versatility of the model and illustrate its ample scope The results Idle simulations showed that a magnetic field can effectively affect the evolution of the grain growth kinetics and texture independently of the initial texture since the magnetic field will cause grains, with particular orientations, to have an advantage for their growth As consequence, the sample will become strongly textured during grain growth Theoretical considerations for the grain boundary migration with a finite mobility of the triple junctions were also reproduced and confirmed by means of computer simulation The simulation results showed a very good agreement with the theoretical expectations (C) 2009 IMACS Published by Elsevier B V All rights reserved", "paper_title": "2D vertex modeling for the simulation of grain growth and related phenomena", "paper_id": "WOS:000277905600005"}
