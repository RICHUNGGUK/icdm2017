It is first proved that there is no spiral arc solution with turning angle less than or equal to pi and then, that any convex solution admits at least two vertices. The curvature and the evolute profiles of such an interpolant are analyzed. In particular, conditions for the existence of a G(2) convex interpolant with prescribed extremal curvatures are given.
