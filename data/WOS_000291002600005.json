However, it is still in its infancy to denoise high dimensional data. In this paper, we extended Sendur and Selesnick's bivariate wavelet thresholding from two-dimensional (2D) image denoising to three-dimensional (3D) data cube denoising. Our study shows that bivariate wavelet thresholding is still valid for 3D data cubes. Experimental results show that bivariate wavelet thresholding on 3D data cube is better than performing 2D bivariate wavelet thresholding on every spectral band separately, VisuShrink, and Chen and Zhu's 3-scale denoising.", "paper_title": "DENOISING OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL DATA CUBE USING BIVARIATE WAVELET SHRINKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000291002600005"}
