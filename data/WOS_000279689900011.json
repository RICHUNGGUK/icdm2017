A (upsilon, K, 1) difference family can be used to construct a (upsilon, K, 1)-PBD. A lot of work has been done on the existence of (upsilon, k, 1) difference families when K = {k} is a singleton. For K = {3, 4}, it is proved that for each prime power upsilon 1 (mod 18) and upsilon >= 19, there exists a balanced (upsilon, K, 1) difference family. In this paper, it is proved that there exists a balanced (upsilon, {3, 6}, 1) difference family for each prime power upsilon equivalent to 1 (mod 36) and upsilon >= 37. An infinite class of optimal frequency-hopping sequence is then obtained.", "paper_title": "The existence of balanced (upsilon, {3,6}, 1) difference families", "paper_id": "WOS:000279689900011"}
