This model is characterized by: (1) 3D geometric semantics: a 3D geometry hierarchy of exterior and interior of buildings is defined; (2) thematic semantics, comprehensive house property object and related property right relationships are illustrated; (3) temporal semantics, dynamic representation of house property driven by both geometric events and property right events is involved. This model facilitates comprehensive data mining to analyze spatial relationships and dynamic change of property rights in real 3D built environments and can also support the sale and lease of real estate, facility management, house planning and so on.", "paper_title": "Semantics-based 3D dynamic hierarchical house property model", "paper_id": "WOS:000275112500001"}
