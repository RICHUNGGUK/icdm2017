Based on entropy and cross entropy, we give two methods to determine the optimal weights of attributes, and develop two pairs of entropy and cross entropy measures for intuitionistic fuzzy values. Then, we discuss the properties of these measures and the relations between them and the existing ones. Furthermore, we introduce three new aggregation operators, which treat the membership and non-membership information fairly, to aggregate intuitionistic fuzzy information. Finally, several practical examples are presented to illustrate the developed methods.
