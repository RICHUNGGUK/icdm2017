In the traditional sense, contrast-set mining identifies attributes, values and instances that differ significantly across groups, and helps user understand the differences between groups of data. We reformulate the notion of contrast-sets for time series data, and define it to be the key pattern(s) that are maximally different from the other set of data. We propose a fast and exact algorithm to find the contrast sets, and demonstrate its utility in several diverse domains, ranging from industrial to anthropology. We show that our algorithm achieves 3 orders of magnitude speedup from the brute-force algorithm, while producing exact solutions.", "paper_title": "Group SAX: Extending the notion of contrast sets to time series and multimedia data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241104900024"}
