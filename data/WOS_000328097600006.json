We present a general description of the solution of this task using the simulated annealing heuristic optimization technique. The experiment was processed in the specialized computer program. For comparison, Appendix A of the article describes the Lagrange multipliers optimization method as the conventional alternative to the used heuristic technique. A description of the concept of intelligent buildings is provided in Appendix B.", "paper_title": "THE USE OF EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS TO OPTIMIZE INTELLIGENT BUILDINGS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY", "paper_id": "WOS:000328097600006"}
