And here, we adopt nonsmooth analysis and control theory to handle memristor-based chaotic neural networks with discontinuous right-hand side. In particular, several new criteria ensuring exponential synchronization of two memristor-based chaotic neural networks are obtained via periodically intermittent control. In addition, the new proposed results here are very easy to verify and also complement, extend the earlier publications. Numerical simulations on the chaotic systems are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
