In this paper we present a scheme for advancing quality of service (QoS) attributes, such as fault tolerance and prioritized scheduling, in OGSA-based mobile Grids. The fault tolerance is achieved by producing and managing sufficient replicas of tasks submitted for execution on the mobile Grid resources. We design a simple and efficient prioritization scheme, which allows the scheduling of the tasks submitted by the Grid users as distinguished priorities that can be managed and exploited as a QoS parameter by the Grid infrastructure operator. The results that are presented show the efficiency of the proposed scheme in being simple and additionally enriching with reliability and QoS features the applications that are built on the concept of mobile Grids.
