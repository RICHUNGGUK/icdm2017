It turns out that discrete versions of these results can be used to prove the existence of strings with prescribed complexity with O(1)-precision (instead of usual O(logn)-precision). In particular, we improve an earlier result of M. Vyugin and show that for every n and for every string x of complexity at least n + O(logn) there exists a string y such that both C(xa y) pound and C(ya x) pound are equal to n + O(1). We also show that for a given tuple of strings x (i) (assuming they are almost independent) there exists another string y such that the condition y makes the complexities of all x (i) twice smaller with O(1)-precision.
