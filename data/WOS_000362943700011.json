Although social event detection has been actively studied, how to efficiently monitor evolving events from continuous tweet streams remains open and challenging. One common approach for event detection from text streams is to use single-pass incremental clustering. However, this approach does not track the evolution of events, nor does it address the issue of efficient monitoring in the presence of a large number of events. In this paper, we capture the dynamics of events using four event operations (create, absorb, split, and merge), which can be effectively used to monitor evolving events. Moreover, we propose a novel event indexing structure, called Multi-layer Inverted List (MIL), to manage dynamic event databases for the acceleration of large-scale event search and update. We thoroughly study the problem of nearest neighbour search using MIL based on upper bound pruning, along with incremental index maintenance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale real-life tweet dataset. The results demonstrate the promising performance of our event indexing and monitoring methods on both efficiency and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Indexing Evolving Events from Tweet Streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000362943700011"}
