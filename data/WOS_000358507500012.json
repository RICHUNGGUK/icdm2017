However, the design of firewall policies, especially for enterprise networks, is complex and error-prone. This paper aims to propose an effective firewall design method to ensure the consistency, compactness and completeness of firewall rules. Specifically, we develop a new designing model, namely firewall design matrix, and the corresponding construction algorithm for mapping firewall rules to firewall design matrix. A firewall generation algorithm is proposed to generate the target firewall rules that are equivalent to the original ones while maintaining the completeness. Theoretical proof and extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic firewalls are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that it can achieve a high compression ratio efficiently while maintaining the firewall rules conflict-free.
