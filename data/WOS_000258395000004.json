The complexity and high integration level of mixed-signal ICs has put forward new challenges to circuit testing. This paper describes an oscillation-based combined self-test strategy for the analog portion and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in integrated mixed-signal circuits. In test mode, the analog portion under test is reconfigured into an oscillator, generating periodic signals as the test stimulus of ADC. By analyzing the A/D conversion results, a histogram test of ADC can be performed, and the oscillation frequency as well as amplitude can be checked, and in this way the oscillation test of the analog portion is realized simultaneously. For an analog benchmark circuit combined with an ADC triangle oscillation and sinusoid oscillation schemes are both given to test their faults. Experimental results show that fault coverage of the analog portion is 92.2% and 94.3% in the two schemes respectively, and faults in the ADC can also be tested.", "paper_title": "Combined self-test of analog portion and ADCs in integrated mixed-signal circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000258395000004"}
