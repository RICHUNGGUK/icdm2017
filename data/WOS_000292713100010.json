Design/methodology/approach - Flow over double-wedge and biconvex airfoils was investigated by the CFD technique using the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model for computation of the Reynolds stresses. Flow was considered compressible, two dimensional and steady. The no slip condition was applied at walls and the Sutherland law was used to calculate molecular viscosity as a function of static temperature. First-order upwind discretization scheme was used for the convection terms. Finite-volume method was used for the entire solution domain meshed by quadratic computational cells. Busemann's theory, shock and expansion wave technique and CHM were the analytical methods used in this work. Findings - Static pressure, static temperature and aerodynamic coefficients of the airfoils were calculated at various angles of attack. In addition, aerodynamic coefficients of the double-wedge airfoil were obtained at various free stream Mach numbers and thickness ratios of the airfoil. Static pressure and aerodynamic coefficients obtained from the analytical and numerical methods were in excellent agreement with average error of 1.62 percent. Variation of the static pressure normal to the walls was negligible in the numerical simulation as well as the analytical solutions. Analytical static temperature far from the walls was consistent with the numerical values with average error of 3.40 percent. However, it was not comparable to the numerical temperature at the solid walls. Therefore, analytical solutions give accurate prediction of the static pressure and the aerodynamic coefficients, however, for the static temperature; they are only reliable far from the solid surfaces. Accuracy of the analytical aerodynamic coefficients is because of accurate prediction of the static pressure which is not considerably influenced by the boundary layer. Discrepancies between analytical and numerical temperatures near the walls are because of dependency of temperature on the boundary layer and viscous heating. Low-speed flow near walls causes transformation of the kinetic energy of the free stream into enthalpy that leads to high temperature on the solid walls; which is neglected in the analytical solutions. Originality/value - This paper is useful for researchers in the area of external compressible flows.
