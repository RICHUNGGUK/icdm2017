Inspired by the local tractability of an argumentation framework, we first propose a decomposition-based approach, and then conduct an empirical investigation. Given a generic argumentation framework, it is firstly decomposed into a set of sub-frameworks that are located in a number of layers. Then, the semantics of an argumentation framework are computed incrementally, from the lowest layer in which each sub-framework is not restricted by other sub-frameworks, to the highest layer in which each sub-framework is most restricted by the sub-frameworks located in the lower layers. In each iteration, the semantics of each sub-framework is computed locally, while the combination of semantics of a set of sub-frameworks is performed in two dimensions: horizontally and vertically. The average results show that when the ratio of the number of edges to the number of nodes of a defeat graph is less than 1.5:1, the decomposition-based approach is obviously efficient.", "paper_title": "Toward incremental computation of argumentation semantics: A decomposition-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000321520600004"}
