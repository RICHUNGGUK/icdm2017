For this reason, the trace data collected from real time monitors are often provided in form of streams for anomaly detection. Due to the dramatic increase of the scale of modern distributed systems, it is challenging to effectively and efficiently discover the anomalies from a voluminous amount of noisy and high-dimensional data streams. Moreover, the evolving of the system infrastructures brings new anomaly types that cannot be generalized as existing ones, making the existing anomaly detection solutions unavailable. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a new type of anomalies called contextual collective anomaly. Then we propose a framework to discover this type of anomaly over a collection of data streams in real time. A primary advantage of this solution is that it can accurately identify the anomalies by taking both the contextual information and the historical information of a data stream into consideration. Also, the proposed framework is designed in a way with a low computational cost, and is able to handle large-scale data streams. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework, we empirically validate it on a real world cluster. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
