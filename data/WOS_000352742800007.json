Firstly, video is divided into several different scenes, and region of interest (ROI) for each I frames would be extracted automatically using the proto-object based saliency attention model. Secondly, the robust watermark and fragile watermark are generated according to ROI. The robust watermark is synthesized by copyright information and ROI of the first I frame for each video scene, and the edge map of ROI in each I frame is chosen as the fragile watermark. Finally, the robust watermark and fragile watermark are embedded into I frames of video scenes so that it can achieve video authentication and copyright information simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to recompression and frame attack, and is also sensitive to tamper at the same time.", "paper_title": "Authentication and copyright protection watermarking scheme for H.264 based on visual saliency and secret sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000352742800007"}
