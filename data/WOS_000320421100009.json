Some focus on the preparation stage and others on the attack stage. In this paper, we will model a path selecting problem before the mission starts and investigate the problem of finding better attack paths in the air-to-ground combat scenarios. We propose a minimal path sum algorithm (MPSA) for path selecting to realize the higher killing probability in one attack. Many necessary factors and their relationships are also studied in this algorithm. Finally, we conduct simulations of our proposed algorithm with multi-UAVs to multi-targets. The simulation results show that the missile's range is the most sensitive factor in many attack scenarios.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS ON MINIMAL PATH SUM ALGORITHM OF AIR-TO-GROUND COMBAT SCENARIOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320421100009"}
