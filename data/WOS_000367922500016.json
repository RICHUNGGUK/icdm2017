We develop a new approach in constructing an efficient revocable IBE scheme. Our approach utilizes recent advances in multilinear maps and combines a two-level hierarchical IBE scheme with a revocation encryption system. In our revocable IBE scheme, both the public parameters and the private key are constant-size. Simultaneously, the size of the update key at some time is only proportional to the number of revoked users at the time. Our proposed scheme is proven secure in the selective revocation list model without relying on random oracles.
