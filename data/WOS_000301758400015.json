First, the reference and the test images are divided into non-overlapping 8 x 8 blocks and transformed into moment domain using Discrete Tchebichef Transform. The moment features are then used in two operations: the local quality index calculation and the image content (block) classification. The local quality index is obtained from the similarity measure of moment vectors between the reference and the test image blocks. Next, the content of each reference image block is classified into three types: \"plain\", \"edge\" and \"texture\", based on its moment energy level and moment energy distribution. The local quality indices obtained from all the image blocks are then averaged based on the block types to obtain three mean quality scores for each test image. The performance of these three mean quality scores and their combinations are studied using the LIVE database. The results show that the performance of the metric is significantly improved by combining the mean quality scores from the edge and texture image region. The best combination (the proposed metric) is then compared with five other IQMs using the LIVE database and four other independent databases. The results show that the proposed metric performs comparatively well for all the databases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
