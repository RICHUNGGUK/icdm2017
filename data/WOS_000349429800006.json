In this context, this work presents the development of a water quality model coupled with GIS (Map Window GIS) for representing impacts of point-sourced pollutants released with distinct durations under different flow scenarios, allowing a systemic view of the entire basin, and capable of being used with low data availability. The model is called SIAQUA-IPH and uses a pollutograph convolution scheme to represent multiple discharges and confluences in the basin, based on analytical solutions of the longitudinal advection-dispersion equation. Operational tests presented a full operational performance from all technical solutions adopted, and a representation of plumes considered satisfactory in comparison to observations. Additionally, a simple sensitivity analysis is presented, that gives useful insights about the model application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
