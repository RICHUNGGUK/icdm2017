As these transformations preserve monotonicity at the level of univariate cumulative distribution functions, they can be used to develop corresponding coordinate-wise transformations of binary aggregation functions. We lay bare the admissibility of these transformations, i.e. the necessary and sufficient conditions under which they result in a binary aggregation function. We investigate which additional properties, such as the 1-Lipschitz property and 2-increasingness, entail these admissibility conditions. Moreover, we point out which of these properties are preserved under flipping and/or cyclic shifting. Interestingly, quasi-copulas remain quasi-copulas under flipping, while copulas remain copulas under flipping as well as under cyclic shifting. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
