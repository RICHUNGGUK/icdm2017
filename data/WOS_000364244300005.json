It is known that RML has the same expressiveness as ML, but the translation of RML into ML is of non-elementary complexity, and RML is at least doubly exponentially more succinct than ML. In this paper, we show that RML-satisfiability is 'only' singly exponentially harder than ML-satisfiability, the latter being a well-known PSPACE-complete problem. More precisely, we establish that RML-satisfiability is complete for the complexity class AEXP(pol), i.e., the class of problems solvable by alternating Turing machines running in single exponential time but only with a polynomial number of alternations (note that NEXPTIME subset of AEXP(pol) subset of EXPSPACE).(1) (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
