It is termed 'linguistic rule-base' instead of 'fuzzy rule-base' because the use of membership functions associated with the linguistic terms are unnecessary or do not play a key role. The features of B-LRB, the ways to generate a B-LRB, and the inference procedure based on B-LRB are specified, along with an illustrate example applied to evaluate consumer trustworthiness in Internet marketing to show how it works, its applicability and feasibility.", "paper_title": "A QUALITATIVE DECISION MAKING MODEL BASED ON BELIEF LINGUISTIC RULE BASED INFERENCE METHODOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000306184900010"}
