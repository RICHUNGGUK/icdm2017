The mechanical properties of elements of a structure are assigned to the members of the graph model, resulting in a weighted graph. Factorization of this graph results in subgraphs for which the eigenvalues can easily be calculated. Decomposition and healing process used in this article reduce the dimensions of the matrices required for stability analysis of symmetric frames. Therefore, the accuracy of calculation increases and the cost of the computation decreases with a fixed discretization, in comparison with classic methods.", "paper_title": "Eigensolution for stability analysis of planar frames by graph symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000246433400006"}
