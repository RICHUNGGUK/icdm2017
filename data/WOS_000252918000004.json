A simple optical model is proposed in which the maternal and fetal blood pulsations result in emulated signals where the lower SNR limit (fetal to maternal) is -25dB. It is shown that a recursive least-squares algorithm is capable of extracting the peaks of the fetal PPG from these signals, for typical values of maternal and fetal tissues. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
