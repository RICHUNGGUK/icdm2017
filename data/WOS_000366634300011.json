A collocation method that uses piecewise polynomials of arbitrary order is developed and analysed for this Volterra problem; then by postprocessing an approximate solution of is computed. Error bounds in the maximum norm are proved for and . Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the sharpness of these bounds.", "paper_title": "An efficient collocation method for a Caputo two-point boundary value problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000366634300011"}
