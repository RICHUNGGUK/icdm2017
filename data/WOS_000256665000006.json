Since the factorization is often used to compute a Newton-like downhill search direction for an optimization problem, the goals are to compute the modification without much additional cost and to keep A + E well-conditioned and close to A. Gill, Murray and Wright introduced a stable algorithm, with a bound of parallel to E parallel to(2) = O(n(2)). An algorithm of Schnabel and Eskow further guarantees parallel to E parallel to(2) = O(n). We present variants that also ensure parallel to E parallel to(2) = O(n). More and Sorensen and Cheng and Higham used the block LBLT supercript stop factorization with blocks of order 1 or 2. Algorithms in this class have a worst-case cost O(n(3)) higher than the standard Cholesky factorization. We present a new approach using a sandwiched LTLT supercript stop-LBLT supercript stop factorization, with T tridiagonal, that guarantees a modification cost of at most O(n(2)).", "paper_title": "Modified Cholesky algorithms: a catalog with new approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000256665000006"}
