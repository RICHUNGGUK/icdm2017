The main feature is as a speed-up and error-correcting mechanism known, in engineering control theory, to be efficient in improving the speed of response and accuracy of any control system. We use the CODAM model to generate a set of predictions as to how such speed-up is achieved, as well as relate to previous explanations by CODAM of various attention-based phenomena.
