This paper presents an improved holding strategy. In the strategy, a mathematical model aiming to minimize the total waiting times of passengers at the current stop and at the following stops is constructed and a new heuristic algorithm, shuffled complex evolution method developed at the University of Arizona (SCEUA), is adopted to optimize the holding times of early buses. Results show that the improved holding strategy can provide better performance compared with a traditional schedule-based holding strategy and no-control strategy. The computational results are also evidence of the feasibility of using SCE-UA in optimizing the holding times of early buses at a stop.", "paper_title": "Bus holding strategy based on shuffled complex evolution method", "paper_id": "WOS:000307266300011"}
