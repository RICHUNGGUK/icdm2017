The algorithm relies on the concept of bounding the matching function: finding an efficiently computable upper bound of the NCC rapidly prunes those candidates that cannot provide a better NCC score with respect to the current best match. In this framework, we apply a succession of increasingly tighter upper bounding functions based on Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Moreover, by including an online parameter prediction step into EBC, we obtain a parameter free algorithm that, in most cases, affords computational advantages very similar to those attainable by optimal offline parameter tuning. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly accelerate a full-search equivalent template matching process and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Fast full-search equivalent template matching by enhanced bounded correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254275000009"}
