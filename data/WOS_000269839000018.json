Given two Markov chains describing a boundary, an algorithm is presented which determines whether a PRF consistent with the distribution on the boundary and a 2-D constraint exists. Iterative scaling is used as part of the algorithm, which also determines the conditional probabilities yielding the maximum entropy for the given boundary description if a solution exists. A PRF is defined for the domino tiling constraint represented by a quaternary alphabet. PRF models are also presented for higher order constraints, including the no isolated bits (n.i.b.)constraint, and a minimum distance 3 constraint by defining super symbols on blocks of binary symbols.", "paper_title": "Block Pickard Models for Two-Dimensional Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000269839000018"}
