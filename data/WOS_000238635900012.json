This architecture can offer IP-based services, compatible with those obtainable by 3G packet switched domain, to a 3G subscriber who is connected via a WLAN. Following this approach, in this paper we propose extensions to current 3GPP specifications, implementing and experimenting with a hybrid WLAN-3G network architecture capable of supporting subscriber's certificates. We focus on attribute certificates, which are of major importance for user authorization and, due to their temporary nature, entail minimum concern regarding revocation issues. We emphasise on the necessary public key infrastructure incorporation which requires minimum changes in 3G core network elements and signalling and provide a list of the potential threats, which can be identified in a presumable deployment. Apart from the description and requirements of the proposed WLAN-3G architecture, particular emphasis is placed on the experimental evaluation of the performance of two alternative test-bed scenarios, which shows that digital certificates technology is not only feasible to implement in present and future heterogeneous mobile networks, but also can deliver flexible and scalable services to subscribers, without compromising security.
