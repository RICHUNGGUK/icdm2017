Bauso, L. Giarre, G. Neglia, Active queue management stability in multiple bottleneck networks. IEEE ICC'04, vol. 4, June 2004, pp. 2267-2271]. In this paper, we study the stability of more general AIMD (Additive Increase and Multiplicative Decrease)/RED system with multiple bottlenecks that may incur non-negligible packet losses. We develop a general mathematical model to analyze network stability for both delay-free and delayed AIMD/RED systems. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of multiple-bottle neck systems with heterogeneous delays are derived by appealing to Lyapunov stability theory with Lyapunov-Razumikhin conditions. and these conditions can be easily assessed by using LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) Toolbox. Numerical results with Matlab and simulation results with NS-2 are given to validate the analytical results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
