By constructing suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii- like composite energy functional and employing some analysis techniques, a differential-difference mixed parametric learning law and an adaptive learning control law are constructed to achieve the adaptive synchronization of reaction-diffusion fuzzy cellular neural networks with unknown periodically time-varying parameters. Finally, a numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive synchronization of delayed reaction-diffusion FCNNs via learning control approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800011"}
