Neither free weighting matrices nor model transformations are employed in the derivation, instead, by constructing an improved Lyapunov function and introducing an extended Jessen's inequality, an improved stability criteria is obtained. The H-infinity controller is shown in terms of nonlinear matrix inequalities, which can be computed through solving a convex optimization problem. Numerical examples are exploited to show the usefulness and effectiveness of the results obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
