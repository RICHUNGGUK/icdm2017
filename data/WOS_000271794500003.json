This method combines the benefit of the discontinuous Galerkin method and the streamline diffusion finite element method. Two fully discrete DFDSD schemes (Euler DFDSD, and Crank-Nicolson (CN) DFDSD) are constructed by making use of the difference discrete method for time variables and the discontinuous streamline diffusion method for space variables. The stability and optimal L(2) norm error estimates are established for the constructed schemes. This method makes contributions to the discontinuous methods. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the benefit of high efficiency and simple implementation of the schemes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
