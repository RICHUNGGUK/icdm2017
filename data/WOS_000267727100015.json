They underlie the recently-proposed algebraic method for diagonalization of the nuclear collective model Hamiltonian in an SU(1, 1) x SO(5) basis. We present a computer code for explicit construction of the SO(5) superset of SO(3) spherical harmonics and use them to compute the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients needed for collective model calculations in an SO(3)-coupled basis. With these Clebsch-Gordan coefficients it becomes possible to compute the matrix elements of collective model observables by purely algebraic methods.

Evaluation of SO(3)reduced matrix elements and SO(5) superset of SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (isoscalar factors). Solution method: Construction of SO(5) superset of SO(3) spherical harmonics by orthonormalization, obtained from a generating set of functions, according to the method of Rowe, Turner, and Repka [1]. Matrix elements and Clebsch-Gordan coefficients follow by construction and integration of SO(3) scalar products. Running time: Depends strongly on the maximum SO(5) and SO(3) representation labels involved. A few minutes for the calculation in the Mathematica notebook. References: [1] D.J. Rowe, P.S. Turner, J.
