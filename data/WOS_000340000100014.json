In this paper, we present a novel continuous formulation of the weighted locally optimal projection (WLOP) operator based on a Gaussian mixture describing the input point density. Our method is up to 7 times faster than an optimized GPU implementation of WLOP, and achieves interactive frame rates for moderately sized point clouds. We give a comprehensive quality analysis showing that our continuous operator achieves a generally higher reconstruction quality than its discrete counterpart. Additionally, we show how to apply our continuous formulation to spherical mixtures of normal directions, to also achieve a fast robust normal reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Continuous Projection for Fast L-1 Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000340000100014"}
