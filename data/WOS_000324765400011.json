As a result, traditional video compression algorithms cannot be directly applied to Kinect-like depth compression with respect to coding efficiency. In this paper, we propose a lossy Kinect-like depth compression framework based on the existing codecs, aiming to enhance the coding efficiency while preserving the depth features for further applications. In the proposed framework, the Kinect-like depth is reformed first by divisive normalized bilateral filter (DNBL) to suppress the depth noises caused by disparity normalization, and then block-level depth padding is implemented for invalid depth region compensation in collaboration with mask coding to eliminate the sharp variation caused by depth measurement failures. Before the traditional video coding, the inter-frame correlation of reformed depth is explored by proposed 2D+T prediction, in which depth volume is developed to simulate 3D volume to generate pseudo 3D prediction reference for depth uniqueness detection. The unique depth region, called active region is fed into the video encoder for traditional intra and inter prediction with residual coding, while the inactive region is skipped during depth coding. The experimental results demonstrate that our compression scheme can save 55%-85% in terms of bit cost and reduce coding complexity by 20%-65% in comparison with the traditional video compression algorithms. The visual quality of the 3D reconstruction is also improved after employing our compression scheme.", "paper_title": "Kinect-Like Depth Data Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000324765400011"}
