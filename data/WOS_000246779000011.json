Design/methodology/approach - The paper studies characteristics such as the character of semicycles, periodicity and the global stability of the above mentioned difference equation. Findings - In particular, the results solve the open problem introduced by Kulenovic and Ladas in their monograph, Dynamics of Second Order Rational Difference Equations with Open Problems and Conjectures. Originality/value - The global behaviour of the solutions of equation y(n+1) = (py(n) +Yn-k)/(qy(n)+ y(n-k)), n=0,1,2.... were investigated providing valuable conclusions on practical data.", "paper_title": "On a recursive sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000246779000011"}
