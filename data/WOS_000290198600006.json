A particular example of this situation can be pinpointed in the development of control software for mechatronic products: design is not carried out in a concurrent way in order to exploit the synergy among domain experts and many \"last minute\" problems are detected and forcefully solved in the control software domain at an advanced development stage. Unfortunately, industrially applicable research to improve integration in the development process is currently at a stale. This work addresses system architecting introducing a model, a method, and a tool implementation, which aim to help changing this situation by supporting cooperative design, providing usable documentation and improving understanding of the design process by the stakeholders.
