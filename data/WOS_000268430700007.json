Complex Morlet wavelets are used at the nodes of both single and double-node networks to model the waveforms with the double-node rendering smaller modeling error. The features extracted from the model parameters have been compared with the conventional time domain features in a two-class clustering experiment with nearly 90% matching between the clusters of different parameter sets and with the model parameters forming clusters more closely distributed around their means and better separated from each other. Moreover, using simulated crackles embedded on real respiratory sounds, features extracted from wavelet networks have been shown to be more robust to background vesicular sounds compared to conventional parameters which are very sensitive to noise.
