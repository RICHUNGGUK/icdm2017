In this paper, we compare various multi-resolution decomposition algorithms, especially the latest developed image decomposition methods, such as curvelet and contourlet, for image fusion. The investigations include the effect of decomposition levels and filters on fusion performance. By comparing fusion results, we give the best candidates for multi-focus images, infrared-visible images, and medical images. The experimental results show that the shift-invariant property is of great importance for image fusion. In addition, we also conclude that short filter usually provides better fusion results than long filter, and the appropriate setting for the number of decomposition levels is four.
