The fuzzy relational databases containing these two kinds of fuzziness simultaneously are called extended possibility-based fuzzy relational databases. In this article, we focus on such fuzzy relational databases and investigate three update operations for the fuzzy relational databases, which are Insertion, Deletion, and Modification, respectively. We develop the strategies and implementation algorithms of these operations.
