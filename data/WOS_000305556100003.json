Further, there is a greater learning curve in bringing in new members and growing the team. This study examines the challenges of new product development in mid-to-large-sized companies in a global supply chain arena. It provides for a formal and standard product lifecycle and cycle-time compression process that leverages technology function deployment (TFD) product development framework. An in-depth comparative analysis of TFD methodological framework employed in design and development of three different consumer products featuring varying level of technology sophistication is offered.", "paper_title": "Leveraging product design and development in manufacturing using technology function deployment approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000305556100003"}
