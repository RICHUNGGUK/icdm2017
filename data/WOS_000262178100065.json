To achieve intelligent design at the initial ship design stage, many researchers have made much significant progress in this field, however, most of them only focused oil how to find tile similar constructed ships. At present, how to utilize these existing data remains all untouched topic. In order to make good use of the existing data and reduce the dependence oil designers' experience, a novel system named Expert System for Aided Conceptual Design of Ship's Engine Room Automation (ESACD), is elaborated ill this study. With the support of the constructed Ship Data Warehouse System, two core subsystems Configuration Selection Assistant (CSA) and Design Scheme Decision Assistant (DSDA) are included in ESACD. A promising approach integrating Fuzzy c-means algorithm (FCM) and Rough Sets Theory (RST) to extract configuration rules from the stored data is adopted in CSA. According to engineers' proposals, RST is utilized to reason knowledge in incomplete scheme information systems for getting design scheme rules in DSDA, which are useful suggestions for engineers to get better schemes at this stage. Finally, tile validity and necessity of this interactive expert system are demonstrated through the CDSER of a new 50,000 DWT Handymax bulk carrier. It is proved that ESACD call efficiently facilitate rapid and intelligent design ill CDSER, and reduce the cost of a new ship design. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
