As a part of this research, a novel 3D planar-based depth representation is proposed. The planar approximation of multiple depth images are formulated as an energy-based co-segmentation problem by a Markov random field model. The energy terms of this problem are designed to mimic the rate-distortion tradeoff for a depth compression application. A novel algorithm is developed for practical utilization of the proposed planar approximations in stereo depth compression. The co-segmented regions are also represented as layered planar structures forming a novel single-reference MVD format. The ability of the proposed layered planar MVD representation in decoupling the texture and geometric distortions make it a promising approach. Proposed 3D planar depth compression approaches are compared against the state-of-the-art image/video coding standards by objective and visual evaluation and yielded competitive performance.", "paper_title": "3D Planar Representation of Stereo Depth Images for 3DTV Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000344590500002"}
