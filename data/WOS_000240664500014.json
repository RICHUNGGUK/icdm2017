The MobiGate Coordination Language (MCL) system provides a language-based approach to the building of mobile applications running in an adaptive middleware, MobiGATE. The concept of the separation of concerns forms the underlying and unifying principle in the provision of the adaptive composition of services. Specifically, a coordination language, MCL, is designed to provide rich constructs supporting the definition of compositions, with constrained type validation and checking. In particular, MCL is formalized by means of the design of a semantic model based on the Z language, which can be used to analyze architectural descriptions and detect possible composition errors such as feedback loops and open circuit problems.
