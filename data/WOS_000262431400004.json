To achieve high sensitivity, avalanche multiplication in a-Se is adopted to make the detector sensitive to each incident X-ray. The use of a-Si:H technology enables large-area imaging of protein diffraction patterns at less expense compared to existing charge coupled device (CCD) and imaging plate (IP) detectors. In addition. a theoretical analysis shows that the detector exhibits fast readout speed (readout time < 1s), high dynamic range (similar to 10(6)), high sensitivity (similar to 1 X-ray photon), and high detective quantum efficiency (similar to 0.7), thus validating its suitability for protein crystallography.", "paper_title": "Selenium-based amorphous silicon flat-panel digital X-ray imager for protein crystallography", "paper_id": "WOS:000262431400004"}
