This paper investigates a multi-criteria decision making problem where the weight information is partially known. We firstly propose the hesitant fuzzy positive ideal solution and the hesitant fuzzy negative ideal solution. Motivated by the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an ideal Solution) method, we definite the satisfaction degree of an alternative, based on which several optimization models are derived to determinate the weights. Subsequently, in order to make a more reasonable decision, we introduce an interactive method based on some optimization models for multi-criteria decision making problems with hesitant fuzzy information. Finally, a practical example on evaluating the service quality of airlines is provided to illustrate our models and method.", "paper_title": "Satisfaction Degree Based Interactive Decision Making under Hesitant Fuzzy Environment with Incomplete Weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000341300200004"}
