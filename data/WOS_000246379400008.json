More specifically, the author relates the different sources and effects of social capital to the different implementation phases, with their differing knowledge management challenges. By doing so, he highlights the relative importance of the bridging and bonding aspects of social capital that vary during different phases because of the different types of knowledge that become more or less important over the lifecycle of the project - embrained, embodied, encultured, embedded, and encoded.", "paper_title": "Overcoming knowledge management challenges during ERP implementation: The need to integrate and share different types of knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000246379400008"}
