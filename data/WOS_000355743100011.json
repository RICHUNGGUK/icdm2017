This, along with other phenomena, such as name abbreviation, name misspelling, and human error lead to erroneous aggregation of records of multiple persons under a single reference. Such mistakes affect the performance of document retrieval, web search, database integration, and more importantly, improper attribution of credit (or blame). The task of entity disambiguation partitions the records belonging to multiple persons with the objective that each partition is composed of records of a unique person. Existing solutions to this task use either biographical attributes, or auxiliary features that are collected from external sources, such as Wikipedia. However, for many scenarios, such auxiliary features are not available, or they are costly to obtain. Besides, the attempt of collecting biographical or external data sustains the risk of privacy violation. In this work, we propose a method for solving entity disambiguation task from timestamped link information obtained from a collaboration network. Our method is non-intrusive of privacy as it uses only the graph topology of an anonymized network. Experimental results on two real-life academic collaboration networks show that the proposed method has satisfactory performance.", "paper_title": "Name disambiguation from link data in a collaboration graph using temporal and topological features", "paper_id": "WOS:000355743100011"}
