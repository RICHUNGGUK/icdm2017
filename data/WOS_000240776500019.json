The result is obtained by the reduction from the subset sum problem with preprocessing to CVPP infinity. The reduction also shows the NP-hardness of CVP infinity, which is much simpler than all previously known proofs. In addition, we also give a direct reduction from exact 3-sets kcover problem to CVPP infinity.", "paper_title": "The hardness of the closest vector problem with preprocessing over l(infinity) norm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500019"}
