Recent years have seen the development of many community detection algorithms which can be mainly classified into two kinds: graph partition in computer science and hierarchical clustering in sociology. The vast majority of these methods, however, are computationally demanding, which largely limit their application to small, at most moderate scale networks. Here we present a very Simple Agglomerative Strategy (SAS) to detect community structure based on closeness among vertices, which not only yields excellent results but also has very low time complexity. The algorithm is tested on several real-world networks and proved to be high efficient and effective in community finding. The running time of the whole algorithm is only O(m (k) over bar) for sparse networks, where (k) over bar is the mean vertex degree and m is the number of edges in the network.", "paper_title": "A SIMPLE BUT FAST AGGLOMERATIVE STRATEGY TO DETECT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE BASED ON VERTEX CLOSENESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500005"}
