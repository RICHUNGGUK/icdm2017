Under group buying, group size significantly affects the waiting cost to which consumers have different tolerances. In this paper, we develop a two-stage pricing game to evaluate the impact of the waiting cost, competition, and group-facilitating technology on the profitability and efficiency of community-based group buying. Our results point out that when a monopolistic retailer operates a mixed channel, the retailer will charge a relatively high group rates in the group-buying channel to force most consumers to choose individual buying unless the transaction cost in the individual-buying channel is sufficiently high. If two competing retailers adopt different pure channels, investment in group-facilitating technology may weaken the profit of the retailer adopting community-based group buying when the actual selling-cost saving resulted from community-based group buying is not significant.", "paper_title": "Analysis of pricing strategies for community-based group buying: The impact of competition and waiting cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000305746400012"}
