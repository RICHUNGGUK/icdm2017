The University of Pavia has recently integrated i2b2 infrastructure with a registry of inherited arrhythmogenic diseases. Within this project, the authors created a novel i2b2 cell, named R Engine Cell, which allows the communication between i2b2 and the R statistical software. As survival analyses are routinely performed by cardiology researchers, the authors have first concentrated on making Kaplan-Meier analyses available within the i2b2 web interface. To this aim, the authors developed a web-client plug-in to select the patient set on which to perform the analysis and to display the results in a graphical, intuitive way. R Engine Cell has been designed to easily support the integration of other A-based statistical analyses into i2b2.", "paper_title": "R Engine Cell: integrating R into the i2b2 software infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000289960600017"}
