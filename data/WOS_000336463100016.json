The aim is to eliminate the key escrow problem of identity-based cryptography. However, most of the work takes place in traditional certificateless cryptography, which suffers from the single-point problem. Hierarchical cryptography exploits a practical security model to mirror the organizational hierarchy in the real world and hence can eliminate the single-point problem. To incorporate the advantages of both types of cryptosystems, in this paper we instantiate hierarchical certificateless cryptography by formalizing the notion of hierarchical certificateless signatures. A concrete hierarchical certificateless signature scheme is also proposed. The security of our scheme is proven under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. As to efficiency, our scheme has constant complexity, regardless of the depth of the hierarchy. Therefore, our proposal is secure and scalable. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
