The approach is based on a domain specific language simplifying the execution of experiments by using an easily comprehensible and straight-forward design scheme. By laying out a clear logical structure, experiment descriptions provide the user with the possibility to only focus on the crucial matter of experiments. An experiment description file serves as the input for a software tool that executes the experiment automatically, thus being able to use a reliable timing for all specified actions. We developed this approach as DES-Cript for the DES-Testbed at the Freie Universitat Berlin, but it is not limited to this particular testbed.", "paper_title": "An Experiment Description Language for Wireless Network Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000280568400005"}
