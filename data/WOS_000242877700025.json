The proposed method consists of the following two main processes to analyze and estimate efficiently the noise from the noisy speech. First, a least-squares line is used, which is obtained by applying coefficient magnitudes in node with a uniform wavelet packet transform to a least squares method. Next, a differential forgetting factor and a correlation coefficient per subband are applied, where each subband consists of several nodes with the uniform wavelet packet transform. In particular, this approach has the ability to update noise estimation by using the estimated,noise at the previous frame only instead of employing the statistical information of long past frames and explicit nonspeech frames detection consisted of noise signals. In objective assessments, we observed that the performance of the proposed method was better than that of the compared methods. Furthermore, our method showed a reliable result even at low SNR.", "paper_title": "Adaptive noise estimation using least-squares line in wavelet packet transform domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000242877700025"}
