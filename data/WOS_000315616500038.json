It includes several pathologies with similar symptoms, what makes the diagnosis really difficult. I-ioflupane allows to obtain in vivo images of the brain that can be used to assist the PS diagnosis and provides a way to improve its accuracy. In this paper a new method for brain SPECT image feature extraction is shown. This novel Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), which decomposes any non-linear and non-stationary time series into a small number of oscillatory Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) a monotonous Residuum. A 80-DaTSCAN image database from the \"Virgen de las Nieves\" Hospital in Granada (Spain) was used to evaluate this method, yielding up to 95% accuracy, which greatly improves the baseline Voxel-As-Feature (VAF) approach.
