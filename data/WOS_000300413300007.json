In the design of integral sliding surfaces, a set of specified matrices are employed such that the connections among sliding surfaces corresponding to each mode are established. And then, a sliding mode controller depending on the transition rates is synthesised such that the reachability of the specified sliding surface can be ensured. Moreover, sufficient conditions for the stability of the sliding motions are derived. It is shown that the effect of Markovian switching can be coped with by the present sliding mode control method. Finally, the simulation results illustrating the proposed method are provided.", "paper_title": "Sliding mode control for Markovian jumping systems with actuator nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000300413300007"}
