High reliability of MINs can be achieved using fault tolerance techniques. The fault tolerance is generally achieved by disjoint paths available through multiple connectivity options. The gamma interconnection network (GIN) is a class of fault tolerant MINs providing alternate paths for source-destination node pairs. Various 2-disjoint and 3-disjoint GIN architectures have been presented in the literature. In this paper, two new designs of 4-disjoint paths multistage interconnection networks, called 4-disjoint gamma interconnection networks (4DGIN-1 and 4DGIN-2) are proposed. The proposed 4DGINs provide four disjoint paths for each source-destination pair and can tolerate three switches/link failures in intermediate interconnection layers. Proposed designs are highly reliable GIN with higher fault-tolerant capability than other gamma networks at low cost. Terminal pair reliabilities of proposed designs and various other 2-disjoint and 3-disjoint GINs are evaluated, analyzed and compared. Reliability values of proposed designs are found higher.", "paper_title": "Design of 4-disjoint gamma interconnection network layouts and reliability analysis of gamma interconnection Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338843200030"}
