They generalise the relational notion of domain - the set of all states that are related to some other state - to a wide range of models. They are internal since the algebras of state spaces are induced by the domain axioms. They are simpler and conceptually more appealing than previous two-sorted external approaches in which the domain algebra is determined through typing. They lead to a simple and natural algebraic approach to modal logics based on equational reasoning. The axiomatisations have been developed in a new style of computer-enhanced mathematics by automated theorem proving, and the approach itself is suitable for automated systems analysis and verification. This is demonstrated by a fully automated proof of a modal correspondence result for Lab's formula that has applications in termination analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
