This paper adds two new contributions. First, a study of the correlation between Gene Ontology (GO) terms and family similarity demonstrates that protein families constitute an appropriate baseline for validating GO similarity. Secondly, we introduce GraSM, a novel method that uses all the information in the graph structure of the Gene Ontology, instead of considering it as a hierarchical tree. GraSM gives a consistently higher family similarity correlation on all aspects of GO than the original semantic similarity measures. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
