However, due to the face image quality degradation caused by large camera standoff and low illuminance, nighttime face recognition at large standoff is challenging. In this paper, we report a system that is capable of collecting face images at large standoff in both daytime and nighttime, and present an augmented heterogeneous face recognition (AHFR) approach for cross-distance (e.g., 150 m probe vs. 1 m gallery) and cross-spectral (near-infrared probe vs. visible light gallery) face matching. We recover high-quality face images from degraded probe images by proposing an image restoration method based on Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). The restored face images are matched to the gallery by using a heterogeneous face matcher. Experimental results show that the proposed AHFR approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for cross-spectral and cross-distance face matching. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
