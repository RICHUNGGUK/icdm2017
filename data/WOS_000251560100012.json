The paper has two parts with similar structures. In the first part, we transform the uncertain additive linguistic preference relations into the expected additive linguistic preference relations, and present a procedure for group decision making based on multiple types of additive linguistic preference relations. By using the deviation measures between additive linguistic preference relations, we give some straightforward formulas to determine the weights of decision makers, and propose a method to reach consensus among the individual preferences and the group's opinion. In the second part, we extend the above results to group decision making based on multiple types of multiplicative linguistic preference relations, and finally, a practical example is given to illustrate the application of the results.
