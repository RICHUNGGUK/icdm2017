In recent years, various mapping schemes have been developed to reserve VN resources over substrate networks. However, many cloud providers are very concerned about improving service reliability under catastrophic disaster conditions yielding multiple system failures. To address this challenge, this work presents a novel failure region-disjoint VN mapping scheme to improve VN mapping survivability. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem and then two heuristic solutions are proposed to compute a pair of failure region-disjoint VN mappings. The solution also takes into account mapping costs and load balancing concerns to help improve resource efficiencies. The schemes are then analyzed in detail for a variety of networks and their overall performances compared to some existing survivable VN mapping schemes.", "paper_title": "Survivable Cloud Network Mapping for Disaster Recovery Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000357929500019"}
