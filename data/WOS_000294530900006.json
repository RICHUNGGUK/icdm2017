In a GNDP, the node set of a graph is partitioned into \"clusters,\" and the feasible solutions must contain one node from each cluster. Up to now, the polyhedra associated with different GNDPs have been studied independently. The purpose of this article is to show that it is possible, to a certain extent, to derive polyhedral results for all GNDPs simultaneously. Along the way, we point out some interesting connections to other polyhedra, such as the quadratic semiassignment polytope and the boolean quadric polytope. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
