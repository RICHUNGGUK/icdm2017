Additional matching edges between the leaves give a one-to-one correspondence between pairs of leaves of the different trees. Our goal is to find two planar embeddings of the two trees (drawn without crossings) that minimize the number of crossings of the matching edges. We derive both (classical) complexity results and (parameterized) algorithms for this problem (and some variants thereof).(1) (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
