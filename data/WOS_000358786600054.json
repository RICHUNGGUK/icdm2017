The materials currently available for use in 3D printing are too fine for large-scale objects, and CNC gantry sizes limit the scope of printable objects. In this paper, we propose a new method for printing architecture-scale objects. Our proposal includes three developments: (i) a construction material consisting of chopsticks and glue, (ii) a handheld chopstick dispenser, and (iii) a printing guidance system that uses projection mapping. The proposed chopstickglue material is cost effective, environmentally sustainable, and can be printed more quickly than conventional materials. The developed handheld dispenser enables consistent feeding of the chopstickglue material composite. The printing guidance system - consisting of a depth camera and a projector evaluates a given shape in real time and indicates where humans should deposit chopsticks by projecting a simple color code onto the form under construction. Given the mechanical specifications of the stickglue composite, an experimental pavilion was designed as a case study of the proposed method and built without scaffoldings and formworks. The case study also revealed several fundamental limitations, such as the projector does not work in daylight, which requires future investigations.", "paper_title": "Architecture-Scale Human-Assisted Additive Manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358786600054"}
