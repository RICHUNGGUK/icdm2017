Most existing solutions merely handle the two issues separately. We propose an integrated approach to handle them together, by presenting an effective transductive multi-label classification approach that simultaneously models the labeling consistency between the visually similar videos and the multi-label interdependence for each video. We compare the performance between the proposed approach and several representative transductive and supervised multi-label classification approaches for the video concept detection task over the widely used TRECVID data set. The comparative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
