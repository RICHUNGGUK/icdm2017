This game is a stochastic game with symmetric hidden information. This paper reviews alpha-beta search with chance nodes and proposes heuristics on Chinese Dark Chess programs. We propose an application of nondeterministic Monte Carlo Tree Search with random nodes for tackling partial observation. The proposed methods were implemented in the program Diablo, which won four Chinese Dark Chess tournaments in TAAI 2011/2012, TCGA 2011/2012 computer game tournaments. Diablo also played hundreds of games with different human players and programs based on alpha-beta search. These results show that the nondeterministic MCTS equipped with our heuristics is promising for Chinese Dark Chess.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of Chinese Dark Chess Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000351542300007"}
