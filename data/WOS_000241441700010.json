It is based on the characterization property of orthonormal wavelets via their autocorrelation functions. The algorithm does not involve any wavelet-based decomposition in the normal sense, yet it uses a multiresolution formula as a crucial element in a CBP type procedure valid for both the parallel and complex fan beam geometries. The algorithm can be used for wavelet based image analysis.", "paper_title": "Wavelet based multilevel backprojection algorithm for parallel and fan beam scanning geometries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241441700010"}
