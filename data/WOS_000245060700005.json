The human pose can be estimated from silhouette in monocular images. The contribution of this paper consists of three points: First, human model of convolution surface is presented and its shape is deformable when changing polynomial parameters and radius parameters. Second, convolution surface and curve correspondence theorem is presented to give a map between 3D pose and 2D contour. Third, we model the human silhouette with convolution curve in order to estimate joint parameters from monocular images and we also give an effective constraint function. Evaluation of this approach is performed on some video frames about a walking man. The experiment result shows that our method works well without self-occlusion. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
