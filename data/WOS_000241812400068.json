These purposes are varied: learning to argue and discuss, learning through argumentation and discussion, and creating shared knowledge, are only some of them. This diversity, together with the unique graphic activity that Digalo requires, makes the analysis of Digalo e-discussions more complex compared to the analysis of other types of e-discussions (e.g. discussion forums). Models developed by educational researchers for analyzing electronic discussions, turn out to be insufficient for the analysis of Digalo activities, as they neglect some of the distinctive learning aspects Digalo activities contain. We therefore decided to develop a new method of analysis. This paper describes our considerations at the beginning of the development process, while focusing on the problems and challenges identified so far.", "paper_title": "Analysing graphic-based electronic discussions: Evaluation of students' activity on Digalo", "paper_id": "WOS:000241812400068"}
