According to the decoding formula of the sink nodes, we can see that, at the time k + delta in order to decode the source packet generated at time k, the sink node should know all the source packets generated before k - 1. This is impractical. The two schemes we devised make it unnecessary. A construction algorithm is also given about the RPTS networks. For the two schemes, we analyze the strengths and weaknesses and point out their implemented condition.", "paper_title": "Practically Feasible Design for Convolutional Network Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409200009"}
