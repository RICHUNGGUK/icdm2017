An edge e of a graph G is said to be double-col-critical if the colouring number of G- V (e) is at most the colouring number of G minus 2. A connected graph G is said to be double-col-critical if each edge of G is double-col-critical. We characterise the double-col-critical graphs with colouring number at most 5. In addition, we prove that every 4-col-critical non-complete graph has at most half of its edges being double-col-critical, and that the extremal graphs are precisely the odd wheels on at least six vertices. We observe that for any integer k greater than 4 and any positive number epsilon, there is a k-col-critical graph with the ratio of double-col-critical edges between 1 - epsilon and 1.", "paper_title": "On graphs double-critical with respect to the colouring number", "paper_id": "WOS:000362971100003"}
