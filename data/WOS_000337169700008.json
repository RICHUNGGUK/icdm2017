The smartphone user can then download a smaller patch. Experiments show that performance yields 49 percent more reduction relative to Google's solution, increasing the savings in cellular network bandwidth use and resulting in lighter application server loads. This reduction in Android application-update traffic could translate to a 1.7 percent decrease in annual US cellular traffic. Similar methods applied to iPhone application updates could yield even greater savings.", "paper_title": "DELTA plus plus : Reducing the Size of Android Application Updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000337169700008"}
