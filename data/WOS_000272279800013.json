In this paper, we study the flexible flowshop scheduling where setup times are anticipatory sequence-dependent and transportation times are job-independent. We also assume that there are several transporters to carry jobs. The objective is to minimize total weighted tardiness. We first formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. With this, we solve small-sized instances to optimality. Since this problem is known to be NP-hard, we then propose an effective metaheuristic to tackle large-sized instances. This metaheuristic, called electromagnetism algorithm (EMA), originates from the attraction-repulsion mechanism of the electromagnetism theory. We conduct a series of experiments and complete statistical analyses to evaluate the performance of the proposed MILP model and EMA. On a set of instances, we first tune the parameters of EMA. Then, the efficiency of the model and general performance of the proposed EMA are assessed over a set of small-sized instances. To further evaluate EMA, we compare it against two high performing metaheuristics; existing in the literature over a set of large-sized instances. The results demonstrate that the proposed MILP model and EMA are effective for this problem.
