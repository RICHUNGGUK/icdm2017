We show an influence of the audio encoder (e.g., bitrate) on the speaker model quality. The model of each speaker was calculated with the use of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approach. Both the speaker recognition and the further analysis were realized with the use of short utterances to facilitate real time processing. The neighborhoods of the speaker models were analyzed with the use of the ISOMAP algorithm. The experiments were based on four 1-hour public debates with 7 8 speakers (including the moderator), acquired from the Polish radio Internet, services. The presented software was developed with the MATLAB environment.", "paper_title": "REAL TIME RECOGNITION OF SPEAKERS FROM INTERNET AUDIO STREAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000363054000004"}
