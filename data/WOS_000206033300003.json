The proposed scheme offers two important security properties: the seal-healing re-keying message distribution which features periodic one-way re-keying with implicitly authentication, efficient tolerance for the lost re-keying messages, and seamless Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) switch without disrupting ongoing data transmissions; and the time-limited dynamic node attachment and detachment, so that both forward and backward secrecy is assured by dual directional hash chains. It is shown that the communication and computation overhead of the proposed protocol is light, and the protocol is robust under poor communication channel quality and frequent group node topology change.
