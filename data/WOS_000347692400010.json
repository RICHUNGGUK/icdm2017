One of the most powerful types of attack on watermarks is the collusion attack, in which multiple users compare their differently watermarked versions of the same content. Collusion-resistant codes have been developed against these attacks. One of the most famous such codes is the Tardos code. It has the asymptotically optimal property that it can resist attackers with a code of length proportional to . Determining error rates for the Tardos code and its various extensions and generalizations turns out to be a nontrivial problem. In recent work we developed an approach called the convolution and series expansion (CSE) method to accurately compute false positive accusation probabilities. In this paper we extend the CSE method in order to make it possible to compute a bound on the False Negative accusation probabilities.", "paper_title": "False Negative probabilities in Tardos codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000347692400010"}
