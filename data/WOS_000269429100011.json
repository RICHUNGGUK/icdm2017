Similarly, a fault-free cycle in Q(n) is long if it has length at least 2n - 2f. If all faulty vertices are from the same bipartite class of Q(n), such length is the best possible. We show that for every set of at most 2n - 4 faulty vertices in Q(n) and every two fault-free vertices u and v satisfying a simple necessary condition on neighbors of u and v, there exists a long fault-free path between u and v. This number of faulty vertices is tight and improves the previously known results. Furthermore, we show for every set of at most n(2)/10 + n/2 + 1 faulty vertices in Q(n) where n >= 15 that Q(n) has a long fault-free cycle. This is a first quadratic bound, which is known to be asymptotically optimal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
