This assumption implies that the text contained in the visual block in which an image is located, called image-block, should contain significant information about the page contents. In this paper we propose a new metric, called the Inverse Term Importance Metric, aimed at assigning higher weights to important terms contained into important image-blocks identified by performing a visual layout analysis. We propose different methods to estimate the visual image-blocks importance, to smooth the term weight according to the importance of the blocks in which the term is located. The traditional TFxIDF model is modified accordingly and used in the classification task. The effectiveness of this new metric and the proposed block evaluation methods have been validated using different classification algorithms. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
