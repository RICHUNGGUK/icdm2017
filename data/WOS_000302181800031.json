Our idea is to propose a variational method containing an energy functional to determine both a stitched image and weighting mask functions of multiple input images for image blending. The existence of the solution of the proposed energy functional is shown. We also present an alternative minimizing algorithm to solve the proposed model numerically and show the convergence of this algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed model works effectively and efficiently and that the proposed method is competitive with the tested existing methods under noisy conditions.", "paper_title": "A Variational Method for Multiple-Image Blending", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800031"}
