It was found that CO molecule is weakly adsorbed on the pristine and SW defected graphenes and their electronic properties were slightly changed. The Al- and Si- doped graphenes show high reactivity toward CO, so calculated adoption energies are about -11.40 and -13.75 kcal mol(-1) in the most favorable states. It was found that, among all the structures, the electronic properties of Al-doped graphene are strongly sensitive to the presence of CO molecule. We demonstrate the existence of a large E-g opening of 0.87 eV in graphene which is induced by Al-doping and CO adsorption.", "paper_title": "A large gap opening of graphene induced by the adsorption of CO on the Al-doped site", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600009"}
