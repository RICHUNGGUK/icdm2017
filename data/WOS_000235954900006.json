It is an extension of traditional access control within client-side domain, digital rights management by payment-free applications, and originator control on recipients' re-dissemination rights allowance. Different application domains may adopt dynamically different resource dissemination policies, but current DCON models cannot solve the multi-policy coexistence and compatibility problems. A dynamic multi-policy dissemination control model (DMDCON) is proposed to express the dynamic and multi-policy nature existing in reality, which are indispensable for well formed resource dissemination control application. The goal of this paper is to de ne and extend formally some basic concepts related with resource dissemination (such as dissemination policy, chain, tree, etc.) and further, propose a comprehensive DMDCON model to describe universal resource dissemination applications through specifying temporal dissemination features, restrictions, and policy revocation (cascade or non-cascade). Finally, we brie y discuss the importance of DCON within the usage control domain.", "paper_title": "Tubwards a dynamic multi-policy dissemination control model (DMDCON)", "paper_id": "WOS:000235954900006"}
