In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (ABTA) with the good nodes set-based crossover operator. The good nodes set is utilized here for initializing the bacteria population, constructing the crossover operator, and dispersing the similar individuals in the ABTA. A novel adaptive computational chemotaxis is incorporated into our algorithm as well. A hybrid selection approach based on the Pare to-dominance and tournament selection can effectively retain the best individuals in the population. We examine the proposed ABTA using 11 well-known test functions, and compare its performances with other constrained optimization methods. Three interesting engineering design problems are also used to verify the efficiency of our ABFA.", "paper_title": "AN ADAPTIVE BACTERIAL FORAGING ALGORITHM FOR CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281072400020"}
