Then we focus on derivation, active state set, membership assignment, output mappings, and concept of belonging to an output label according to the entrance input strings X(X is an element of Sigma*) for BL-general fuzzy automata. Therefore, we define the concepts of run map and behavior of BL-GFA. After that we present the morphism with threshold tau(1)/tau(2) between two BL-general fuzzy automata. Moreover we give some examples, between two BL-general fuzzy automata. Moreover we give some examples, to clarify these notions. Finally, we prove some theorems. In particular, we show that the isomorphic BL-general fuzzy automata have the same behavior.", "paper_title": "Isomorphism between two BL-general fuzzy automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000301479400013"}
