A key component for achieving long-term tracking is the tracker's capability of updating its internal representation of targets (the appearance model) to changing conditions. Given the rapid but fragmented development of this research area, we propose a unified conceptual framework for appearance model adaptation that enables a principled comparison of different approaches. Moreover, we introduce a novel evaluation methodology that enables simultaneous analysis of tracking accuracy and tracking success, without the need of setting application-dependent thresholds. Based on the proposed framework and this novel evaluation methodology, we conduct an extensive experimental comparison of trackers that perform appearance model adaptation. Theoretical and experimental analyses allow us to identify the most effective approaches as well as to highlight design choices that favor resilience to errors during the update process. We conclude the paper with a list of key open research challenges that have been singled out by means of our experimental comparison.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Appearance Modeling for Video Tracking: Survey and Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309056700002"}
