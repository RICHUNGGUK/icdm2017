In this paper, an effort is made to characterize the parameters for developing a reconfigurable Stewart platform for the Contour generation application. A solution is provided through the formulation of dimensionless parameters in combination with a study on the generic parameters like configuration. The variable geometry approach for the reconfiguration of Stewart platform has been adopted for four different platforms, and a generic approach is formulated after studying different parameters. A stiffness model developed for contour generation application is used in tandem with this generic approach to identify the trajectory with maximum stiffness for complex contours. The proposed methodology provides a holistic approach to develop a complete set of design tool to choose the optimum geometry for any new reconfigurable Stewart platform to be developed.
