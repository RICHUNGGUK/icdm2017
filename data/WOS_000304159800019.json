Our experimental results show improved compression performance w.r.t. to a benchmark compression scheme, accurate correlation estimation by our proposed particle-based belief propagation algorithm, and significant peak signal-to-noise ratio improvement over traditional separate bit-plane decoding without dynamic correlation and disparity estimation.", "paper_title": "Onboard Low-Complexity Compression of Solar Stereo Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000304159800019"}
