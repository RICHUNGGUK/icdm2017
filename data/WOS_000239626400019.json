An 'action description' in C+ defines a labelled transition system of a certain kind. nC+ (formerly known as (C+)(++)) is an extended form of C+ designed for representing normative and institutional aspects of (human or computer) societies. The deontic component of nC+ provides a means of specifying the permitted (acceptable, legal) states of a transition system and its permitted (acceptable, legal) transitions. We present this component of nC+, motivating its details with reference to some small illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "The deontic component of action language nC", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626400019"}
