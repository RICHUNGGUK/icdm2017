On this matter, Gabor wavelets has proven to be a useful technique to characterize distinctive texture patterns. However, most of the approaches used to extract descriptors of the Gabor magnitude space usually fail in representing adequately the richness of detail present into a unique feature vector. In this paper, we propose a new method to enhance the Gabor wavelets process extracting a fractal signature of the magnitude spaces. Each signature is reduced using a canonical analysis function and concatenated to form the final feature vector. Experiments were conducted on several texture image databases to prove the power and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results obtained shown that this method outperforms other early proposed method, creating a more reliable technique for texture feature extraction. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
