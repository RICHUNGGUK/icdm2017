Due to that the sun gear is not directly connected to the planetary gear, an accelerated-speed profile is required to provide necessary driving torque. In this paper, a fuzzy logic control scheme is considered. Particularly, an energy compensation scenario is proposed so that stabilizing equilibrium can be preserved regardless of the initial positions. Compared with conventional energy-based method, the proposed fuzzy controller provides better control performance with short transition period and disturbance-free.", "paper_title": "Swing up and balance control of planetary train type pendulum with fuzzy logic and energy compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000257848300004"}
