Like the linear force method, the method is suitable for both statically and kinematically indeterminate assemblies, which have been widely used in non-traditional structures such as tension structures and tensegrities. The geometrically non-linear force method is able to produce much more accurate solutions when the infinitesimal mechanisms exist in the assembly, which has been illustrated by a number of examples.
