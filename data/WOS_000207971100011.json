This paper presents a new method of detecting community based on representative energy. The method can divide the communities and find the representative of community simultaneously. The communities of network emerges during competing for the representative among nodes in network, thus we can sketch structure of the whole network. Without the optimizing by modularity, the community of network emerges with competing for representative among those nodes. To obtain the proximate relationships among nodes, we map the nodes into a spectral matrix. Then the top eigenvectors are weighted according to their contributions to find the representative node of a community. Experimental results show that the method is effective in detecting communities of networks.", "paper_title": "Detecting community structure in networks by representative energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100011"}
