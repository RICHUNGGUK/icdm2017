This problem can be divided to many categories considering different viewpoints. Different approaches of modeling (continuous and discrete models) and various system structures (control in end node or routers) are some of these categories. The most significant method in control of such systems is Delayed Feedback Controller (DFC). In this paper, a discrete model is considered and a new algorithm Integral DFC (IDFC) is presented that has many preferences over similar algorithms, which are illustrated by simulation results and analytical discussions.
