In BoW, a visual codebook of visual words is defined, usually by clustering local features, to represent any novel image with the occurrence of its contained visual words. Given a set of images, we argue that the significance of each image is determined by the significance of its contained visual words. Traditionally, the significances of visual words are defined by term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf), which cannot necessarily capture the intrinsic visual context. In this paper, we propose a new scheme of latent visual context learning (LVCL). The visual context among images and visual words is formulated from latent semantic context and visual link graph analysis. With LVCL, the importance of visual words and images will be distinguished from each other, which will facilitate image level applications, such as image re-ranking and canonical image selection. We validate our approach on text-query based search results returned by Google Image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and potentials of our LVCL in applications of image re-ranking and canonical image selection, over the state-of-the-art approaches.
