We have developed TRUMP, a toolchain which allows composing MAC solutions at runtime [1] [2]. In this demonstration, we will show how MAC reconfiguration can be achieved efficiently using TRUMP. Inspired by the optimum route calculation method used in car navigation systems, the compiler toolchain in TRUMP realizes an appropriate MAC solution at runtime. TRUMP allows expressing various types of constraints and options such as speed, energy consumption and packet delivery rate which leads to different MAC compositions. The live demonstration of MAC reconfiguration will be carried out on WARP SDR platform [3].", "paper_title": "Demo: Runtime MAC Reconfiguration Using a Meta-compiler Assisted Toolchain", "paper_id": "WOS:000309217600043"}
