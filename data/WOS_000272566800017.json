As Adleman proposed before,. the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strands employed towards calculating solution to The NP-complete Hamiltonian Path Problem (HPP). Lipton. also demonstrated that Adleman's techniques could be used to solve the satisfiability (SAT) problem. Our paper proposes a new biological molecular model using the Adleman-Lipton model. First we developed all of the basic logical gates (bio-logical units) such as parallel AND, parallel OR, and parallel XOR which are used to construct bio-logic arithmetic units for NP problem solving. Two of the bio-logic arithmetic units that are developed in this paper are parallel adder and parallel multiplier.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTING BIO-LOGICAL MOLECULAR PARALLEL ADDER AND MULTIPLIER USING THE ADLEMAN-LIPTON MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000272566800017"}
