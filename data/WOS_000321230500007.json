Typically, word retrieval problems can be treated through word naming therapeutic exercises. In fact, the frequency and the intensity of speech therapy are key factors in the recovery of lost communication functionalities. In this sense, speech and language technology can have a relevant contribution in the development of automatic therapy methods. In this work, we present an on-line system designed to behave as a virtual therapist incorporating automatic speech recognition technology that permits aphasia patients to perform word naming training exercises. We focus on the study of the automatic word naming detector module and on its utility for both global evaluation and treatment. For that purpose, a database consisting of word naming therapy sessions of aphasic Portuguese native speakers has been collected. In spite of the different patient characteristics and speech quality conditions of the collected data, encouraging results have been obtained thanks to a calibration method that makes use of the patients' word naming ability to automatically adapt to the patients' speech particularities.
