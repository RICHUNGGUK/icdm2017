Recently, screening experiments in molecular biology has become the most important application. In this paper, we review several models in this application by focusing on decoding, namely, giving a comparative study of how the problem is solved in each of these models.", "paper_title": "A survey on nonadaptive group testing algorithms through the angle of decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000251643600004"}
