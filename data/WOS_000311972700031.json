This is a significant improvement over existing geometric continuity degree reduction methods. The general equations for G(2)- and G(3)-multi-degree reduction schemes are non-linear; we were able to simplify these non-linear equations to linear ones by requiring C-1-continuity. Our linear solution is given in an explicit, non-iterative form, and thus has lower computational costs than existing methods which were either non-linear or iterative. Further, there are no other existing G(3)-methods for multi-degree reduction. We give some examples and figures to demonstrate the efficiency, simplicity, and stability of our methods.
