However, the lack of scene-specific information inherently handicaps these scanning algorithms. We address this issue by automatically building an adaptive, focus-of-attention, scene-specific model using standard PTZ camera hardware. The adaptive model is constructed by first detecting local human activity (i.e., any translating object with a specific temporal signature) at discrete locations across a PTZ camera's entire viewable field. The temporal signature of translating objects is extracted using motion history images (MHIs) and an original, efficient algorithm based on an iterative candidacy-classification-reduction process to separate the target motion from noise. The target motion at each location is then quantified and employed in the construction of a global activity map for the camera. We additionally present four new camera scanning algorithms which exploit this activity map to maximize a PTZ camera's opportunity of observing human activity within the camera's overall field of view. We expect that these efficient and effective algorithms are implementable within current commercial camera systems.", "paper_title": "An adaptive focus-of-attention model for video surveillance and monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908200004"}
