These courses are supported by an e-learning system - Programming Assignment aSsessment System (PASS), which aims at providing an infrastructure and facilitation to students learning computer programming A research model is adopted linking various motivating factors, self-efficacy, as well as the effect due to the e-learning system. Some factors are found to be notably more motivating, namely, 'individual attitude and expectation', 'clear direction', and 'reward and recognition' The results also suggest that a well facilitated e-learning setting can enhance learning motivation and self-efficacy (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
