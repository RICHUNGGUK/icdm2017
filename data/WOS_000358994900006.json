However, if the V2V is the only communication system used, the restrictions of the urban environment and network drop the performance of VANET. In order to improve the performance of the network, it is necessary to use V2I communication as well as V2V communication. Therefore, RSUs must be placed in the environment. However due to the high costs of placement, the full coverage of the environment would not be possible. Therefore, it is necessary to optimally install a limited number of RSUs in the environment. In this article a graph-based model is presented to find optimal location of RSUs in the urban scenario. All the urban and VANETs limitations have been applied to the graph in form of weight. Solving the Steiner tree problem leads to find optimal places to install RSUs. In the following, the presented model extends to support QoS requirement of service advertisement and discovery. The simulation results, based on real traces, shows an improvement in performance of the given model in comparison with the other scenarios of RSUs placement.", "paper_title": "A Graph-based Model for RSUs Deployment in Vehicular Networks by Considering Urban and Network Limitations and QoS Requirements of Service Advertisement and Discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000358994900006"}
