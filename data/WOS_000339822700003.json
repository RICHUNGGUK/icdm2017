Anal. 20(2): 307-330, 2012). Firstly, in the particular case of convex minimization problems, we derive convergence rates for the partial primal-dual gap function associated to a primal-dual pair of optimization problems by making use of conjugate duality techniques. Secondly, we propose for the general monotone inclusion problem two new schemes which accelerate the sequences of primal and/or dual iterates, provided strong monotonicity assumptions for some of the involved operators are fulfilled. Finally, we apply the theoretical achievements in the context of different types of image restoration problems solved via total variation regularization.", "paper_title": "Convergence Analysis for a Primal-Dual Monotone plus Skew Splitting Algorithm with Applications to Total Variation Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000339822700003"}
