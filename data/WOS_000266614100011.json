Without considering the generation of input, this algorithm can be performed in O(1) in a test tube using O(n) different types of DNA strands, and the output can be detected in O(n). The output strands, prior to read out operation, can serve as the input strands for another round of addition. The algorithm can be easily extended to any other logical operation, and even for adding two decimal numbers.", "paper_title": "A CONSTANT TIME ALGORITHM FOR DNA ADD", "paper_id": "WOS:000266614100011"}
