We show that the LSH feasibility problem is NP-hard even in the following strong promise version: either S admits an LSH or S is at l(1)-distance at least n(2-is an element of) from every similarity that admits an LSH. We complement this hardness result by providing an (O) over bar (3(n)) algorithm for the LSH feasibility problem, which improves upon the naive n(Theta(n)) time algorithm; we prove that this running time is tight, modulo constants, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.
