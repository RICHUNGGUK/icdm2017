Based on the Neural Network theory and combining with the Micro-chip processor technology, we design an expert system-\" Integrated Cars Repairing Tools\" (ICRT) and the size of the proposed ICRT is quite small and achieves the following attractive functions: (1) Portable Electric-jack, (2) Electric Tire-pressure-meter, (3) efficiently Pneumatic tire machine, (4) LCD type Sparing Battery, (5) trouble blinking sign and lighting device. Compare to the traditional single function tools-\"Handjack\", \"Mechanic tire-pressure-meter\", \"Pressure-stat pneumatic tire machine\", and \"Hand-held glitch indicator\", the proposed innovative expert system-ICRT has the following special features: the Portable Electric-jack can easily and rapidly lift cars, the Electric Tire-pressure-meter works precisely, the efficiently pneumatic tire machine works rapidly, the LCD type Sparing Battery with the capability to show the residual capacity of Power and can be used to start cars easily. We install the proposed ICRT in several different types of cars and make numerous simulations, the test results show that the ICRT is efficient for rejecting the frequent glitches of cars.
