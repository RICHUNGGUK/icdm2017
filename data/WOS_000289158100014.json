The EGPSO uses a group-based framework to incorporate crossover and mutation operations into particle-swarm optimization. The EGPSO dynamically forms different groups to select parents in crossover operations, particle updates, and replacements. An adaptive velocity-mutated operation (AVMO) is incorporated to improve search ability. The EGPSO is applied to design all of the free parameters in a zero-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK)-type FC. The objective of EGPSO is to improve fuzzy-control accuracy and design efficiency. Comparisons with different population-based optimizations of fuzzy-control problems demonstrate the superiority of EGPSO performance. In particular, the EGPSO-designed FC is applied to mobile-robot navigation in unknown environments. In this application, the robot learns to follow object boundaries through an EGPSO-designed FC. A simple learning environment is created to build this behavior without an exhaustive collection of input-output training pairs in advance. A behavior supervisor is proposed to combine the boundary-following behavior and the target-seeking behavior for navigation, and the problem of dead cycles is considered. Successful mobile-robot navigation in simulation and real environments verifies the EGPSO-designed FC-navigation approach.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary-Group-Based Particle-Swarm-Optimized Fuzzy Controller With Application to Mobile-Robot Navigation in Unknown Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000289158100014"}
