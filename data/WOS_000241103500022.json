We have chosen several PoS taggers and two WSD methods. By combining them, and using different kind of information, several experiments have been carried out. The WSD systems have been evaluated using the corpora of the lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-3 for English. The results show that some PoS taggers work better with one specific method. That is, selecting the right combination of these tools, could improve the results obtained by a WSD system.", "paper_title": "A study of the influence of PoS tagging on WSD", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500022"}
