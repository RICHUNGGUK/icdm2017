Besides, as a basis function, it is suitable to sparsely represent natural scenes due to its property in maximizing information. It is argued that Gabor-like receptive fields are emerged by sparseness-enforcing or infomax method. In this paper, we incorporate Gabor overcomplete representation into quantum holography for image recognition tasks, with suggestions in improvements through iterative method for reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Face Recognition with Quantum Associative Networks Using Overcomplete Gabor Wavelet", "paper_id": "WOS:000292777400008"}
