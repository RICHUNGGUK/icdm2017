This is done for different levels of cell cooperation. At one extreme, we consider single cell processing where the BS is oblivious to the interference it is creating at the other cell. At the other extreme, we consider full cooperative macroscopic beamforming. In between, we consider coordinated beamforming, which takes account of inter-cell interference, but does not require full cooperation between the BSs. We combine elements of Lagrangian duality and large system analysis to obtain limiting SINRs and bit-rates, allowing comparison between the considered schemes. The main contributions of the paper are theorems which provide concise formulas for optimal transmit power, beamforming vectors, and achieved signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) for the considered schemes. The formulas obtained are valid for the limit in which the number of users per cell,, and the number of antennas per base station, N, tend to infinity, with fixed ratio beta = K/N. These theorems also provide expressions for the effective bandwidths occupied by users, and the effective interference caused in the adjacent cell, which allow direct comparisons between the considered schemes.", "paper_title": "Base Station Cooperation on the Downlink: Large System Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000302079800006"}
