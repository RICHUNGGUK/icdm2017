In other words, for such processes to perform accurately, critical features of motion sequences need to occur simultaneously. In this paper, we propose correlation-optimized time warping (CoTW) for aligning motion data. CoTW utilizes a correlation-based objective function for characterizing alignment. The method solves an optimization problem to determine the optimum warping degree for different segments of the sequence. Using segment-wise interpolated warping, smooth motion trajectories are achieved that can be readily used for animation. Our method allows for manual tuning of the parameters, resulting in high customizability with respect to the number of actions in a single sequence as well as spatial regions of interest within the character model. Moreover, measures are taken to reduce distortion caused by over-warping. The framework also allows for automatic selection of an optimum reference when multiple sequences are available. Experimental results demonstrate the very accurate performance of CoTW compared to other techniques such as dynamic time warping, derivative dynamic time warping and canonical time warping. The mentioned customization capabilities are also illustrated.", "paper_title": "Correlation-optimized time warping for motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000364126900001"}
