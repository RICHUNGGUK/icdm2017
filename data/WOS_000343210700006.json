We present an efficient algorithm for finding DC equilibria to establish a condition that ensure the oscillator is free from lock-up. Further, we present a formal verification solution for the problem. Using dynamical systems theory, we show that any oscillator must have a non-empty set of states from which it fails to start properly. However, it is possible to show that these failures only occur with zero probability. To do so, this paper generalizes the \"cone argument\" initially presented in (Mitchell and Greenstreet, in Proceedings of the third workshop on designing correct circuits, 1996) and proves the soundness of this generalization. This paper also shows how concepts from analog design such as differential operation can be soundly incorporated into the verification to produce simpler models and reduce the complexity of the verification task.", "paper_title": "Verifying global start-up for a Mobius ring-oscillator", "paper_id": "WOS:000343210700006"}
