Both in the case of sampling and patrolling, the mission consists in periodically visiting proper locations of the environment in order to estimate the field of interest or check for unexpected events. In previous work of the same authors, it has been shown that these tasks can be addressed by a proper combination of Gaussian Processes and Voronoi tessellation tools. The Gaussian Processes allow to put these tasks in a probabilistic framework, while the Voronoi tessellation allows to distribute the overall strategy as well as the handling of asynchronous communication or possible loss or adjunct of vehicles. The approach was already tested in simulation by varying all the parameters of interest as well as on a set-up composed by three marine surface vehicles. In this paper, experiments are extended to the still challenging scenario of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) communicating by acoustic modems and moving in the 3D space. The experiments were run in the La Spezia harbour, in Italy, as demo of the European project CO(3)AUV5. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
