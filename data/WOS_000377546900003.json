This is obtained by maximizing the network throughput subject to a target detection probability. With Rayleigh fading and energy detector, the proposed algorithm simultaneously optimizes the number of sensing samples at a local node, the number of bits for quantizing local sensing data and the global threshold at a fusion center.", "paper_title": "How Many Bits Should Be Reported In Quantized Cooperative Spectrum Sensing?", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900003"}
