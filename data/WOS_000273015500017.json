The Bayesian estimators cannot be obtained in closed forms. An approximate Bayesian approach is proposed using the idea of Lindley and Gibbs sampling procedure is also used to obtain the Bayesian estimators. These results are compared using Monte Carlo simulations with the maximum likelihood method and another approximate Bayesian approach Laplace's approximation. Two real data sets are analyzed for illustrative purposes. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.
