However, a key problem with such systems is their reliance on bespoke content developed for, and only used by, these systems. ne challenge for adaptive systems in scalably supporting personalised elearning is its ability to source, harvest and deliver open corpus content to adaptive content services and personalised elearning systems. This paper examines the issues involved in implementing such an adaptive content service. The paper seeks to explore the accurate extraction of content requirements from the adaptive system, the sourcing and identification of suitable learning content, the harvesting and customisation of the content for delivery to adaptive elearning systems.", "paper_title": "Dynamic content discovery, harvesting and delivery, from open corpus sources, for adaptive systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300067"}
