The failure criteria are developed. Methods to get the rotational displacement and the contact detection algorithm prove good accuracy and efficiency. Taking advantages of this model, a Visual C++6.0 based simulation program, 3DCollap1.0, is developed and then verified by simulating the shaking table test of a RC frame featuring strong-beam-weak-column from minor and moderate earthquakes to severe earthquake which results in structural collapse. The collapse process of a strong-column-weak-beam RC frame is also successfully simulated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
