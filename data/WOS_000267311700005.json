We also define a new notion of refinement, called strong subcontract pre-order, Suitable for strong compliance: given a composition of strong compliant services, we can replace my service with any other service in subcontract relation while preserving the overall strong compliance. Finally, we present a characterisation of the strong subcontract pre-order by resorting to the theory of a (should) testing pre-order.", "paper_title": "A theory of contracts for strong service compliance", "paper_id": "WOS:000267311700005"}
