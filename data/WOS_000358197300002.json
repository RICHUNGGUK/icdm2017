The problem is NP-hard and has applications, for example, in computer vision and in multistage production planning. We describe an algorithm which makes use of a mathematical programming solver in order to find near-optimal solutions to the problem both in acyclic directed graphs and in directed graphs possibly containing directed circuits. It is shown that the proposed technique compares favorably to competiting approaches published in the related literature. Moreover, the experimental evaluation demonstrates that, although mathematical programming solvers are very powerful for this problem, with growing graph size and density they become unpractical due to excessive memory requirements.", "paper_title": "A matheuristic for the minimum weight rooted arborescence problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000358197300002"}
