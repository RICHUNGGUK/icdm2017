Three fully coupled governing equations, considering the soil mechanical behaviour, pore water transport and electrical field, and their numerical implementation within an updated Lagrangian finite element formulation, are presented. The proposed model is first verified against a classical one-dimensional analytical solution for electro-osmosis consolidation to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. Then, various numerical examples are investigated to study the deformation characteristics and time dependent evolution of excess pore pressure. Finally, the importance of considering large strains in a consistent and proper way is demonstrated, and differences compared to models based on small strain theory are highlighted.
