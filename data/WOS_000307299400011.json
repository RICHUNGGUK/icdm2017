The time-space iterative method consists in solving the nonstationary Stokes equations based on the time-space discretization by the Euler implicit/explicit scheme under a weak uniqueness condition (A2). The spatial iterative methods consist in solving the stationary Stokes scheme, Newton scheme, Oseen scheme based on the spatial discretization under some strong uniqueness assumptions. We compare the stability and convergence conditions of the time-space iterative method and the spatial iterative methods. Moreover, the numerical tests show that the time-space iterative method is the more simple than the spatial iterative methods for solving the stationary Navier-Stokes problem. Furthermore, the time-space iterative method can solve the stationary Navier-Stokes equations with some small viscosity and the spatial iterative methods can only solve the stationary Navier-Stokes equations with some large viscosities.
