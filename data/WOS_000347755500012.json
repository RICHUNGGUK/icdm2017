The first objective of the project is the development of new techniques and tools capable to guide and assist the designer in the development process, from UML specifications to implementation and debug on multicore platform. This tool chain will offer the possibility to propose and implement several parallelization strategies and drive the designer into implementation steps. The second objective of the project is to develop monitoring and control techniques in the middleware of the system capable to automatically adapt platform services to applications requirements and therefore reduce power consumption in a transparent manner for applications.
