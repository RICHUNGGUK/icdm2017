To alleviate the computational cost, both in terms of memory and floating-point complexity, we investigate variants based on a sparse approximation or on mixed 32- and 64-bit calculation. The robustness of the preconditioners is illustrated on a set of linear systems arising from the finite element discretization of elliptic PDEs. through extensive parallel experiments on up to 1000 processors. Their efficiency from a numerical and parallel performance view point are studied.
