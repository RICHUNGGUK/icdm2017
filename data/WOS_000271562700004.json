Recently we developed a periodic surface model to assist the construction of nanostructures parametrically for computer-aided nano-design. In this paper, we present a feature-based approach for crystal construction. The proposed approach creates models of basic features with the aid of periodic surfaces followed by operations between basic features. The goal is to introduce a rapid construction method for complex crystal structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
