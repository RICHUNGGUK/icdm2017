It operates directly on the original digitized objects without any surface reconstruction procedure. Based on the Cauchy-Crofton formula from integral geometry, the method estimates the surface area of a volumetric object by counting the number of intersection points between the object's boundary surface and a set of uniformly distributed lines generated with low-discrepancy sequences. Using a clustering technique, we also propose an effective algorithm for computing the intersection of a line with the boundary surface of volumetric objects. A number of digitized objects are used to evaluate the performance of the new method for surface area measurement. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
