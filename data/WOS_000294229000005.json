It proposes concepts and techniques to extract environmental information that are useful for controlling sensor operations, in order to enable sensor nodes to conserve their energy, and consequently prolong the network lifetime. These concepts and techniques are consolidated in a generic framework we term CASE: Context Awareness in Sensing Environments framework. CASE targets energy conservation at the network level. A subset framework of CASE, we term CASE Compact, targets energy conservation at the sensor node level. In this paper, we elaborate on these two frameworks, elucidate the requirements for them to operate together within a WSN and evaluate the applications they can be applied to for energy conservation.", "paper_title": "Energy conservation in wireless sensor networks: a rule-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000294229000005"}
