It contains many frequency components corresponding to specific escapement motion sources with a very wide frequency range. Therefore, it is challenging for signature analysis of mechanical watch by the acoustic signal. This paper studies the time-frequency signatures of the mechanical watch based on wavelet decomposition. Two methods are proposed to improve the frequency resolution of traditional wavelet techniques by combining other beneficial techniques in the sense of decomposing specific mono- or independent components. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is presented to advance the wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) to decompose the mono- component signals. And the blind source separation (BSS) makes the redundancy of continuous wavelet transform (CWT) further gain good frequency resolution in the independent meaning. The decomposed signals by the two methods reveal the insight of mechanical watch movement and can contribute much simpler and clearer time-frequency signatures. Experimental results indicated the effectiveness of the two methods and the value of the time-frequency signatures in analyzing and diagnosing mechanical watch movements.", "paper_title": "MECHANICAL WATCH SIGNATURE ANALYSIS BASED ON WAVELET DECOMPOSITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000268448200008"}
