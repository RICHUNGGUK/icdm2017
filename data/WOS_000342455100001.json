We derive a set of sufficient conditions for throughput optimality of scheduling policies, which encompass and generalize all the results previously obtained in the field. This leads to the definition of new classes of (non-diagonal) throughput optimal scheduling policies. We prove the stability of queues by extending the traditional Lyapunov drift criterion methodology.", "paper_title": "Throughput optimal scheduling policies in networks of constrained queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000342455100001"}
