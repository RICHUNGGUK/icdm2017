In this paper, a Semantic Link Networks (SLN) based SKF generation method is proposed. First, the topics are represented by Element Fuzzy Cognitive Maps then the semantic values of concepts/keywords and relations are calculated. Third, semantic similarity degrees between topics are calculated to build SLN-based semantic values of concepts and their relations in Element Fuzzy Cognitive Maps. In this way, similar relations at the keyword level are extended to the topic level. With the help of SLN and based on user's demand, SKF is generated as the browsing path of topics to guide user browsing behaviors. Finally, the semantic value of SKF is defined as a criterion to evaluate the browsing path of topics. Experimental results show that the browsing path of topics is easy to be activated by SKF which is generated by SLN. The proposed method has been proved to have a very good prospect in the fields of Web services and e-Science applications.
