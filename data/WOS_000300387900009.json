Although JPEG defined 162 different variable length code (VLC) for AC coefficients, many codes are not used during image compression. According to the statistical results of VLC usage in a cover, we map the unused codes to used codes. The relationships of code mapping are performed by modifying the Huffman values defined in the file header. During data hiding, we replace the codes appearing in bitstream by the mapped codes according to the secret bits. The proposed embedding method preserves the image with no quality distortion and provides more embedding capacity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
