The objective of the problem is to minimize the makespan of the system. The problem is formulated as an integer program and the lower bounds are constructed. A special case of the problem is presented and solved in polynomial time. For the general cases, a hybrid genetic algorithm is developed to solve the problem. The algorithm is tested by both randomly generated data sets and real-world data sets from a printing industry. The computational results show that the algorithm is efficient and effective for both types of data sets. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
