This problem occurs in human visual systems as well: we have blind spots (BS), but we see natural patterns in the BS region. This article presents the computational identity between the DII algorithm and the vision model for the filling-in process at the BS. Based on physiological evidence and conjecture, we define an evaluation function that evaluates the quality of filled-in (or inpainted) images. The definition of the evaluation function helps the original DII algorithm to improve the convergence speed. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the convergence speed using the energy function is three times faster than the original DII algorithm. Results show that the resultant filled-in patterns by the visual model are comparable with those of the DII algorithm.", "paper_title": "Computational identity between digital image inpainting and filling-in process at the blind spot", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160200002"}
