Via the fact that single loop feedback control shows a shortcoming in that the plant output as nonzero disturbance acts on the systems, a new model of singular networked cascade control system is proposed. In this system, both the network-induced delay and data packed dropout phenomena are considered. Based on the model, sufficient conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities and the corresponding H-infinity stabilizing controller design technique is also developed based on the above conditions. The proposed method emphasizes the implementation issue and employs the cascade control to singular networked control systems. A simulation example is given to illustrate the proposed design procedures and its applications.", "paper_title": "H-Infinity Stabilization for Singular Networked Cascade Control Systems With State Delay and Disturbance", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800004"}
