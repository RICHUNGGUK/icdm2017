A spanning subgraph C of a hexagonal system H is said to be a Clar cover of H if each of its components is either a hexagon or an edge, the maximum number of hexagons in Clar covers of H is called the Clar number of H. In this paper, we show that the maximum forcing number of a hexagonal system is equal to its Clar numbers, based on this result, we have that the maximum forcing number of the hexagonal systems can be computed in polynomial time, which answers the open question proposed by Afshani etal.[1] when G is a hexagonal system. Moreover, we obtain the maximum forcing number of some special classes of hexagonal systems.", "paper_title": "Maximum Forcing Number of Hexagonal Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000328007000003"}
