When using the same emitting materials, the performance of TEOLEDs employing Ag as anode was superior to that of the device using Au as anode. Finally, by using the appropriate dopant instead of Alq as emitter, a TEOLED with high power efficiency (8.7 lm/w with luminance of 640 cd/m(2)), almost independent on viewing angle had been reported.
