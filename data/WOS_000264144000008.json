Consequently, decision making problems may include preference information in different formats. In this paper, a lattice-based linguistic-valued weighted aggregation (LVWA) operator is proposed for multiple attribute group decision making with non-totally ordered linguistic-valued information. Then some transformation functions for unifying different formats of preference information are reviewed and summarized. Finally, an example is illustrated how to use the LVWA operator and transformation functions for multiple attribute group decision making.", "paper_title": "A LINGUISTIC-VALUED WEIGHTED AGGREGATION OPERATOR TO MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTE GROUP DECISION MAKING WITH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264144000008"}
