First, we find a set of 2-D corresponding points on the vessels' skeleton in the matched image pair. Secondly, NN is utilized to build the relationships between the 3-D points and their projective 2-D points. Thirdly, by feeding the corresponding points we found into the NN, the 3D coordinates of the points on vessels can be obtained. At last we employ B-spline interpolation to improve reconstruction performance. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of the new method.", "paper_title": "3-D reconstruction of blood vessels skeleton based on neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000013"}
