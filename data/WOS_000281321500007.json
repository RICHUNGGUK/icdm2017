Effects of strong electronic correlation of Ce4f states are taken into account through the use of an effective on-site Coulomb repulsive interaction within DFT+U approach. Different combinations of exchange-correlation functionals and corresponding U values reported in the literature are tested and the obtained results compared with experimental data. We found that both absolute values and trends in oxygen vacancy formation energy depend on the value of U and associated with degree of localization of Ce4f states. Effect of oxygen vacancy and geometry optimization method on spatial spin distribution in model ceria nanoparticles is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Density functional study of oxygen vacancy formation and spin density distribution in octahedral ceria nanoparticles", "paper_id": "WOS:000281321500007"}
