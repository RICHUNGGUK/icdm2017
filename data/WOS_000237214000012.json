Given a desired level of atrophy, we find a dense warping deformation that produces the corresponding levels of volumetric loss on the labeled tissue using an energy minimization strategy. Simulated results on a real brain image indicate that the method generates realistic images of tissue loss. The method does not make assumptions regarding the mechanics of tissue deformation, and provides a framework where a pre-specified pattern of atrophy can readily be simulated. Furthermore, it provides exact correspondences between images prior and posterior to the atrophy that can be used to evaluate provisional image registration and atrophy quantification algorithms.", "paper_title": "Simulation of tissue atrophy using a topology preserving transformation model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237214000012"}
