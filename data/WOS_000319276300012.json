We also analyze the performance of 1D and 2D MWML-OOC that can support multirate transmission and quality-of-services (QoS) differentiation in the optical code-division multiple-access networks. The theory of the 1D MWML-OOC is reviewed where its bit-error rate (BER) performance analysis, based on the binomial model of MAI using the convolution technique, is presented and compared with the well-known Poisson model. The results indicated that the overall performance referred to as BER considering the binomial distribution of MAI is better than that obtained from Poisson-modeled MAI for both 1D and 2D MWML-OOCs. It was also found that the extended 2D MWML-OOC can support a greater number of users with reduced chip times and highly improve the BER performance compared with its 1D and 2D counterparts.", "paper_title": "Extended 2D Codes Supporting Multirate and QoS in Optical CDMA Networks With Poisson and Binomial MAI Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000319276300012"}
