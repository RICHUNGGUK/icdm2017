In relation with previous works, the main contribution of this research is the development of a three-dimensional viewer (Diedro-3D) to support the teaching process, encouraging autonomous learning. The Diedro-3D application tries to overcome the main obstacle that student face when using a descriptive geometry textbook: static 2D illustrations of high complexity. This is achieved by providing a series of construction steps and supporting a 3D visualisation environment where the student can freely change the point of view. It is important to note that students show a high degree of satisfaction with the learning experience using Diedro-3D as usability analysis confirms. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
