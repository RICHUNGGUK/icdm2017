The approach investigated here is based on an image region-based classification whose output is the information of the presence or absence of a nodule in an image region. The classification was made, essentially, in two steps: firstly, a set of rotation invariant features was extracted from the responses of a multi-scale and multi-orientation filter bank; secondly, different classifiers (multi-layer perceptrons) are designed using different features sets and trained in different data. These classifiers are further combined in order to improve the classification performance. The obtained results are promising and can be used for reducing the false-positives nodules detected in a computer-aided diagnosis system.", "paper_title": "A multiclassifier approach for lung nodule classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600055"}
