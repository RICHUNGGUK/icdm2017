The first kernel counts the number of common paths and allows for weighing according to path-length and/or according to the vertices contained in each particular path. The second kernel counts the number of paths in common minors of the graphs involved and allows for length- and vertex-weighting too. Both kernels have algorithmic complexity that is cubic in the size of the vertex-set. The performance of the algorithms is concisely demonstrated using synthetic and real data. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
