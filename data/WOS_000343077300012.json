Different from traditional models focusing on visualization effect problems, we propose a novel visualization tool - GC-Curve, which not only solves all the visual effect problems mentioned above, but also can show the GC-content of a DNA. GC-content is an important feature of DNA, which is related to the stability of DNA, the density of genes, natural selection, mutational bias, etc. So the visualization reflecting GC-content has great potential in many applications. The applications of GC-Curve on similarity analysis, GC-content analysis, stability analysis and melting temperature prediction are presented.", "paper_title": "A Novel Visualization of DNA Sequences, Reflecting GC-Content", "paper_id": "WOS:000343077300012"}
