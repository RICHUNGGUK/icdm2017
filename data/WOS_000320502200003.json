In this paper we accomplish this for an input set of arguments, and the result is a partition according to distinct lines of thought, i.e., groups of \"coherent\" ideas. We extend Dung's Argumentation Framework (AF) in order to deal with coalitions of arguments. The initial set of arguments is partitioned into not-intersected subsets. All the found coalitions show the same property inherited by Dung, e.g., all the coalitions in the partition are admissible (or conflict-free, complete, stable): they are generated according to Dung's principles. Each of these coalitions can be assigned to a different agent. We use Soft Constraint Programming as a formal approach to model and solve such partitions in weighted AFs: semiring algebraic structures can be used to model different optimization criteria for the obtained coalitions. Moreover, we implement and solve the presented problem with JaCoP, a Java constraint solver, and we test the code over a small-world network.", "paper_title": "Coalitions of Arguments: An Approach with Constraint Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000320502200003"}
