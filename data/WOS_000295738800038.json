Nonexistence of codes with parameters [33, 18, 8] and [33, 14, 10] is proved. This leads to 8 new exact bounds for binary linear codes. Primarily two algorithms considering the dual codes are used, namely extension of dual codes with a proper coordinate, and a fast algorithm for finding a maximum clique in a graph, which is modified to find a maximum set of vectors with the right dependency structure.", "paper_title": "Results on Binary Linear Codes With Minimum Distance 8 and 10", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738800038"}
