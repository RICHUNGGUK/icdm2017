The control system is composed of the preset model of the dynamic requirement for oxygen blowing and coolant adding, bath [C] and temperature prediction model, and judgment model for blowing-stop. In this method, NN technology is used to construct these models above; Fuzzy Inference (FI) is adopted to derive the control law. The control method of BOF steelmaking process has been successfully applied in some steelmaking plants to improve the bath Hit Ratio (HR) significantly.", "paper_title": "Multiple neural network modeling method for carbon and temperature estimation in basic oxygen furnace", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300127"}
