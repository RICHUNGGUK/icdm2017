However, the employment of such techniques evidently affects the QoS provisioning algorithms at the medium access control (MAC) layer. In this paper, we propose a space-time infrastructure and develop a set of cross-layer real-time QoS-provisioning algorithms for admission control, scheduling, and subchannel-allocations. We analytically map the parameters characterizing the STD onto the admission-control region guaranteeing the real-time QoS. Our analytical analyses show that the proposed algorithms can effectively support real-time QoS provisioning,. Also presented are numerical Solutions and simulation results showing that the STD can significantly improve the QoS provisioning for real-time services over wireless networks.
