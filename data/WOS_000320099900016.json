This article is devoted to the study of the admissibility property for positive continuous-time descriptor systems. Based on Lyapunov inequality existed for stability of positive descriptor systems, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the admissibility via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee the admissibility is established by means of generalised Lyapunov equation if c-monomial decomposition is applied to positive descriptor systems. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the validity of the results obtained.", "paper_title": "Admissibility for positive continuous-time descriptor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900016"}
