The problem is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem, which is difficult to solve. To overcome this problem, a joint user selection and rate adaptation scheme is developed based on the water-filling rate adaptation with the given user set and the power saving criterion with the allocated rates. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with the norm-based and semi-orthogonal user selection algorithms, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the total power consumption. The proposed algorithm can also achieve near-optimal performance compared with the performance achieved by the exhaustive search-based method. In addition, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is reduced by heuristic iteration and search scope shrinking.", "paper_title": "Joint User Selection and Rate Adaptation Scheme in a Coordinated Multipoint Transmission System for Power Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000368923700004"}
