An important process used to secure that communication is authentication. As flaws in the security of a wireless network are discovered, new protocols and algorithms are required to meet those security issues. When creating new algorithms and systems, it is possible that the existing equipment may not be able to implement the new protocols, which means that integration may be required to transition from an old security protocol to the new more secure protocol. Stationary wireless networks were created without a strong need to integrate protocols and have simply developed slightly more secure protocols to protect old equipment. New protocols in stationary wireless networks are implemented without integration as a requirement. Mobile wireless networks have the requirement of allowing old equipment to use the entire network as it is advantageous to allow new mobile equipment to connect to old networking equipment to increase coverage areas and for old equipment to connect to new towers for roaming and billing. This requirement for mobile networks means that integration is required. There are flaws in this integration of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) into Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. Those flaws are analyzed, and two practical solutions are proposed.
