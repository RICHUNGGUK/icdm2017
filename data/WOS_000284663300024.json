It is realized based on the visual region of the laser scanning vision system. The candidate next best view (NBV) position is obtained by computing the unknown space area according to the limit visual region of the vision system. The final NBV position, which can acquire the maximal visual area, is obtained by comparing the above candidate's view positions. Experimental results show successful implantation of the proposed view planning method for digitization and reconstruction of freeform objects. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
