We show that for NC real functions, derivatives and integration are infeasible, but analyticity helps to reduce the complexity. For example, the integration of a log-space computable real function f is as hard as #P, but if f is an analytic function, then the integration is log-space computable. As an application, we study the problem of finding all zeros of an NC analytic function inside a Jordan curve and show that, under a uniformity condition on the function values of the Jordan curve, the zeros are all NC computable.", "paper_title": "On some complexity issues of NC analytic functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800036"}
