We observe that the formation of patch by the toxin-producing phytoplankton decreases the grazing pressure of zooplankton, resulting in stronger coupling between the interacting species determined by the fraction of the phytoplankton population that aggregates to form patches. Finally, the results were validated by comparing them with an alternative spatial model.", "paper_title": "Aggregation of toxin-producing phytoplankton acts as a defence mechanism a model-based study", "paper_id": "WOS:000315583700004"}
