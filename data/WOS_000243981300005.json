Architecture can take advantage of the complexity sciences, by the use of present day computer technology, where algorithms of mathematical and geometric functions can produce new motifs of design. In order to demonstrate this, examples of the use of the elliptic and hyperbolic paraboloid, and the design of a tree on the surface of an elliptic paraboloid, are given. Further, the way to compose relevant algorithms is described. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
