Through finding proper rank-one tensors, the algorithm effectively enhances the pairwise inter-class margins and meanwhile preserves the intra-class local manifold structure. In the algorithm, a novel marginal neighboring graph is devised to describe the pairwise inter-class boundaries, and a differential formed objective function is adopted to ensure convergence. Furthermore, the algorithm has less computation in comparison with the vector representation based and the tensor-to-tensor projection based algorithms. The experiments for the basic facial expressions recognition show its effectiveness, especially when it is followed by a neural network classifier. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
