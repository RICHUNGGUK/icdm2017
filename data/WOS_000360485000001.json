However, it is challenging to acquire fine-grained localization accuracy because of resource constraints of sensor nodes, unreliable wireless communication, and cost. Moreover, heterogeneous characteristics of both sensor nodes and applications make this problem even harder to solve. In this paper, we propose NLMR, a novel on-demand node localization technology based on multiresolution model. NLMR comprises three phases: (1) subregion classification, which categorizes regions into subregions with either uniform node deployment or nonuniform node deployment; (2) multiresolution model construction, which creates a multiresolution model that caters for diverse localization granularity; (3) node localization, which allows the control center to estimate the locations of sensor nodes in a centralized manner. Our analysis and simulation results demonstrate the performance of NLMR and verify that our scheme can provide diverse localization granularity with high probability.", "paper_title": "Localizing Wireless Sensors with Diverse Granularities in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360485000001"}
