Two types of preprocessing were used before the data were analyzed with multivariate calibration methods of principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). A hybrid model combined PLS with PCA was put forwarded. Spectral data set as the logarithms of the reflectance reciprocal was analyzed to build a best model for predicting the sugar and acidity contents of peach. A model with a correlation coefficient of 0.94/0.92, a standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0.50/0.07 and a bias of 0.02/-0.01 showed an excellent prediction performance to sugar/acidity. At the same time, the sensitive wavelengths corresponding to the sugar content and acidity of peaches or some element at a certain band were proposed on the basis of regression coefficients by PLS.", "paper_title": "A hybrid model for nondestructive measurement of internal quality of peach", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300005"}
