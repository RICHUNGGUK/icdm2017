In this brief, we explore this way of constructing binary classifiers, taking advantage of the possibility of generating functional weights by means of a gate with fixed radial basis functions. This particular form of the gate permits training the machine directly with maximal margin algorithms. We call the resulting scheme \"feature combiners with gate generated weights for classification.\" Experimental results show that these architectures outperform support vector machines (SVMs) and Real AdaBoost ensembles in most considered benchmark examples. An increase in the computational design effort due to cross-validation demands is the price to be paid to obtain this advantage. Nevertheless, the operational effort is usually lower than that needed by SVMs.", "paper_title": "Feature Combiners With Gate-Generated Weights for Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000312844800014"}
