Our extensive testing of some of these algorithms has indicated that their performances are strongly dependent upon a variety of factors that are correlated with geographical and-environmental conditions. It is typically the case that one algorithm may perform well in one setting and not so well in another. Thus, fusion methods that take advantage of the stronger algorithms for a given setting without suffering from the effects of weaker algorithms in the same setting are needed to improve the robustness of the detection system. In this paper, we discuss, test, and compare seven different fusion methods: Bayesian, distance-based, Dempster-Shafer. Borda count, decision template, Choquet integral, and context-dependent fusion. We present the results of a cross validation experiment that uses a diverse data set together with results of eight detection and discrimination algorithms. These algorithms are the top ranked algorithms after extensive testing. The data set was acquired from multiple collections from four outdoor sites at different locations using the NIITEK GPR system. This collection covers over 41,807 m(2) of ground and includes 1593 anti-tank mine encounters. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
