Combin. Theory Ser. B 41 (1986) 92-114). While the best function f currently known is exponential in k, a O(k log k) bound is known in the special case where H is a forest. This is a consequence of a theorem of Bienstock, Robertson, Seymour and Thomas on the pathwidth of graphs with an excluded forest-minor. In this paper we show that the function f can be taken to be linear when H is a forest. This is best possible in the sense that no linear bound is possible if H has a cycle.", "paper_title": "Excluded Forest Minors and the Erdos-Posa Property", "paper_id": "WOS:000322953200003"}
