For this purpose. diagnostic features are extracted from current and voltage measurements for monitoring different operating modes. Then, a feature selection method is applied in order to select the most relevant features which define the feature space. In this frame, the classification is realized by a non-parametric method (\"k-nearest neighbors\" rule) with reject options. However, this method does not take into account the evolution of the operating modes. Thus, it is necessary to enhance the initial knowledge database. For that, it polynomial approach allows characterizing the intermediate states of each operating modes and an original use of Kahnan algorithm allows predicting the evolution of the partially known modes. A simple behavioral model is used to describe the evolution of the pattern vector. An estimation step provides the parameter of such model and a prediction step determines the future evolution of the pattern vector. This approach is illustrated on in asynchronous motor of 5.5 M in order to detect broken bars under any load level. The experimental results prove the efficiency of pattern recognition methods in condition monitoring of electrical machines. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
