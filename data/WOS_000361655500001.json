Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) is a widely used model of software testing in both academy and industry. This paper provides a survey on EFSM-based test case generation techniques in the last two decades. All techniques in EFSM-based test case generation are mainly classified into three parts: test sequence generation, test data generation, and test oracle construction. The key challenges, such as coverage criterion and feasibility analysis in EFSM-based test case generation are discussed. Finally, we summarize the research work and present several possible research areas in the future.", "paper_title": "EFSM-Based Test Case Generation: Sequence, Data, and Oracle", "paper_id": "WOS:000361655500001"}
