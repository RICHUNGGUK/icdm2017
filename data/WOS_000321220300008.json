However, the imaging frame rate of this method is limited by the immense computational load required in synthetic beamforming. For fast imaging with a ring array, we developed graphics processing unit (GPU)-based, real-time image reconstruction software that exploits massive data-level parallelism in beamforming operations. The GPU-based software reconstructs and displays three cross-sectional images at 45 frames per second (fps). This frame rate is 4.5 times higher than that for our previously-developed multi-core CPU-based software. In an alternative imaging mode, it shows one B-mode image rotating about the axis and its maximum intensity projection, processed at a rate of 104 fps. This paper describes the image reconstruction procedure on the GPU platform and presents the experimental images obtained using this software.", "paper_title": "GPU-Based Real-Time Volumetric Ultrasound Image Reconstruction for a Ring Array", "paper_id": "WOS:000321220300008"}
