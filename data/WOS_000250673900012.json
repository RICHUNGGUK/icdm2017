While most approaches aim to account for this variability, they do not actively exploit it. Here, we consider a novel approach that uses the variability between arrays to provide an extra source of information that can enhance gene expression analyses. Results: We develop a method that uses sample similarity to incorporate sample variability into the analysis of gene expression profiles. This allows each pairwise correlation calculation to borrow information from all the data in the experiment. Results on synthetic and human cancer microarray datasets show that the inclusion of this information leads to a significant increase in the ability to identify previously characterized relationships and a reduction in false discovery rate, when compared to a standard analysis using Pearson correlation. The information carried by the variability between arrays can be exploited to significantly improve the analysis of gene expression data.", "paper_title": "Exploiting sample variability to enhance multivariate analysis of microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000250673900012"}
