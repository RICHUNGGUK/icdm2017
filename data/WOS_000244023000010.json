Following a multidisciplinary review of the literature, we propose an integrative and cumulative view that is articulated threefold. First, we present an operations resource management, or ORM, framework. Second, we suggest an integrative approach for decision capabilities as they rest on the interaction between humans and systems. Third, we derive a decision model. We show that careful consideration must be given to the interplay among humans, systems, and the environment in which they operate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
