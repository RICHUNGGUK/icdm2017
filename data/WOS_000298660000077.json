The basic idea is to combine the auxiliary model identification idea and the decomposition technique and to decompose a system into two subsystems, which contain one parameter vector each. Compared with the auxiliary model based recursive least squares algorithm, the proposed algorithm has less computational burden. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
