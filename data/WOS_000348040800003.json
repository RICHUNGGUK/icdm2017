Firstly, the notion of interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy filter(IVI (T, S)-fuzzy filter for short) on residuated lattices is introduced by linking the interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy set, t-norm, s-norm and filter theory of residuated lattices; the properties and equivalent characterizations of interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy filter are investigated; the relation between IVI (T, S)-fuzzy filter and filter is studied. Secondly, the notions of interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy implicative filter and interval valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy Boolean filter are introduced; the properties and equivalent characterizations of them are investigated; the intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy implicative filter is proved to be equivalent to the intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy Boolean filter in residuated lattices. Finally, the intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy positive implicative filter and intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy G (MV) filter are introduced; some equivalent characterizations of them are obtained and the relations among these fuzzy filters are investigated.", "paper_title": "Interval-valued intuitionistic (T, S)-fuzzy filters theory on residuated lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040800003"}
