Subsequently, based on Tseng and Tsai's revocable ID-based public key setting, Tsai et al. proposed a new revocable ID-based signature (RIBS) scheme in the standard model (without random oracles). However, their RIBS scheme possesses only existential unforgeability under adaptive chosen-message attacks. In the article, we propose the first strongly secure RIBS scheme without random oracles under the computational Diffie-Hellman and collision resistant assumptions. Comparisons with previously proposed schemes are made to demonstrate the advantages of our scheme in terms of revocable functionality and security property.", "paper_title": "Strongly Secure Revocable ID-based Signature without Random Oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000342544300005"}
