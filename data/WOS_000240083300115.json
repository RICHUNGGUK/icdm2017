A story about the same event or person can have radically different emotions depending on the author, newspaper, and nationality. In this paper we propose a system to judge the emotion of a news article based on emotion word, idiom and modifier dictionaries. This type of system allows one to judge the world opinion on varying topics by looking at the emotion used within news articles about the topic.", "paper_title": "Determining the emotion of news articles", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300115"}
