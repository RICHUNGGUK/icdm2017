We call belief extrapolation the process of completing initial belief sets stemming from observations by assuming minimal change. We give a general semantics and we propose several extrapolation operators. We study some key properties verified by these operators and we address computational issues. We study in detail the position of belief extrapolation with respect to revision and update: in particular, belief extrapolation is shown to be a specific form of time-stamped belief revision. Several related lines of work are positioned with respect to belief extrapolation.
