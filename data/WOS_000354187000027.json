Two and three-echelon networks are considered to maximize profit. The study represents the problem by a bi-level stochastic programming model. The revised ant algorithm proposed in the study improves the existing ant algorithm by using new design of heuristic desirability and efficient greedy heuristics to solve the problem. A set of computational experiments is reported to not only allow to fine-tune the parameters of the algorithm but also to evaluate its performance for solving the problem proposed. Experiments reveal that the proposed solution algorithm can reach 95-99% of the optimal solution against risky demands while consuming only 1000th of the computational time for large-sized problems as compared to an optimization-based tool.
