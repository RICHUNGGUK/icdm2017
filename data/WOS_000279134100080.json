Numerical simulations show that the network displays rich dynamics by changing the self-connection weight. The dynamic of the network is studied by using the Lyapunov exponents spectrum, bifurcation diagram, power spectrum and topological horseshoe theory. It is shown that the proposed network exhibits some novel double-scroll chaotic attractors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
