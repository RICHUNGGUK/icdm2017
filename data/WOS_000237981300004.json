We also describe offline and online metabeuristics as examples of explicit methods to leverage this knowledge. We illustrate the benefits of this approach with four real-world applications. The first application is automated insurance underwriting-a discrete classification problem, which requires a careful tradeoff between the percentage of insurance applications handled by the classifier and its classification accuracy. The second application is flexible design and manufacturing-a combinatorial assignment problem, where we optimize design and manufacturing assignments with respect to time and cost of design and manufacturing for a given product. Both problems use metalieuristics as a way to encode domain knowledge. In the first application, the EA is used at the metalevel, while in the second application, the EA is the object-level problem solver. In both cases, the EAs use a single-valued fitness function that represents the required tradeoffs. The third application is a lamp spectrum optimization that is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. Using domain customized mutation operators, we obtain a well-sampled Pareto front showing all the nondominated solutions. The fourth application describes a scheduling problem for the maintenance tasks of a constellation of 25 low earth orbit satellites. The domain knowledge in this application is embedded in the design of a structured chromosome, a collection of time-value transformations to reflect static constraints, and a time-dependent penalty function to prevent schedule collisions.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary algorithms plus domain knowledge equals Real-world evolutionary computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237981300004"}
