The nonlinear plant in this paper is described by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model. The packet dropouts in both sensor-to-controller (SIC) and controller-to-actuator (C/A) channels are considered, which are modeled by Bernoulli processes. A new compensation scheme for the estimation of missing packets is proposed, and a piecewise state feedback controller is designed so that the resulting closed-loop control system is stochastically stable with guaranteed H-infinity performance. Then the results are extended to the case when both network-induced delays and packet dropouts exist in communication links. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the procedure of the proposed approaches and the optimal H-infinity performance in comparison to the existing approaches.
