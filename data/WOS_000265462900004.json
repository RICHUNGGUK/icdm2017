Depending on substitutions on some key positions of their scaffold they show selectivity towards A(1), A(2A) or A(3) receptors, which results in a variety of therapeutic potentialities of these ligands. In this work, we present a QSAR study on these analogues as antagonists for adenosine A, receptors. Using the MOE software we identified a pool of descriptors that numerically describes the ligand features impacting the affinity at adenosine A, receptors. The obtained information is useful to understand the main structural features that strongly correlate with the A, antagonism in this class of compounds and will be used for the rational design of more potent and selective pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives.", "paper_title": "Exploring the QSAR of Pyrazolo[3,4-b]Pyridine, Pyrazolo[3,4-b]Pyridone and Pyrazolo[3,4-b]Pyrimidine Derivatives as Antagonists for A(1) Adenosine Receptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000265462900004"}
