The fundamentals argue for an increase of the computing power of the primitive level in order to decrease the number of computing levels required to carry out calculations. A weighted primitive substitutes the usual primitives sum and multiplication and calculates the function values by successive iterations. The parametric architecture associated to the weighted primitive is particularly suitable in the case of combined trigonometric functions sine and cosine involved in the calculation of image transforms. The Hough Transform (HT) and the Fourier Transform (FT) are analyzed under this scope, obtaining a good performance and trade-off between speed and area requirements when comparing with other well-known proposals.", "paper_title": "Improvement of image transform calculation based on a weighted primitive", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700025"}
