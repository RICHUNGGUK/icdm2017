In the first case, a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is used as quantum channel; in the second case, the sender needs to construct an quantum channel with both of the assistant of cavity QED and the knowledge about the state to be remotely prepared. In each scheme, only 1 cbit and 1 ebit are needed with the aid of cavity QED. In the third case, we combine the first two protocols and give a theoretical proposal for controlled RSP with only 2 cbits and 1 ebit resources consumption.", "paper_title": "Minimum remote state preparation of an arbitrary two-level one-atom state via cavity QED", "paper_id": "WOS:000354325800003"}
