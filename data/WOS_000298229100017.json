The paper first describes the primary sources of uncertainty arising in UAV guidance and then describes relevant practical techniques that have been reported in the literature. The paper makes a point of distinguishing between contributions from the field of robotics and artificial intelligence, and the field of dynamical systems and controls. Mutual and individual contributions for these fields are highlighted providing a roadmap for tackling the UAV guidance problem.", "paper_title": "Survey of Motion Planning Literature in the Presence of Uncertainty: Considerations for UAV Guidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000298229100017"}
