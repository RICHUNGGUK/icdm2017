A general precoding framework is first presented based on the Gram matrix, which is shown for 2-dimensional (2-D) and 3-dimensional (3D) MIMO systems when employing the ellipse expanding method (EEM). An extended precoder for high-dimensional MIMO system is proposed following the precoding framework, where the Gram matrix for high-dimensional precoding matrix can be generated through those chosen from 2-D and 3-D results in association with a permutation matrix. A complexity-reduced maximum likelihood detector is also obtained according to the special structure of the proposed precoder. The analytical and numerical results indicate that the proposed precoder outperforms the other precoding schemes in terms of both minimum distance and bit error rate (BER).", "paper_title": "Minimum Distance based Precoder Design for General MIMO Systems using Gram Matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000368450500010"}
