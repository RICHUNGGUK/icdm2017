Our adaptive fault localization framework is based on combining passive and proactive monitoring solutions, together with adaptive management in two phases. Numerical results indicate that our proposed scheme has good scalability, in terms of the number of fault monitors required. Also, we show that our framework allows more flexible network design, and requires much less monitoring bandwidth when compared with the passive monitoring solutions.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Fault Monitoring in All-Optical Networks Utilizing Real-Time Data Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000299526400005"}
