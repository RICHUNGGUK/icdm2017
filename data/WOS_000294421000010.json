The proposed technique is based on the structure of radix-2 Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) of length 2(n) where n is an integer. The scheme can provide up to 100 percent detection and correction of isolated single soft errors in the convolution at the cost of little more than double the system area, rather than triple, as is required when using conventional Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR).", "paper_title": "Offset DMR: A Low Overhead Soft Error Detection and Correction Technique for Transform-Based Convolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000294421000010"}
