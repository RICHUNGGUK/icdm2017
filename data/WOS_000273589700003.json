For n objects in space and a parameter r is an element of N, a 1/r-cutting is a covering of the space with simplices such that the interior of each simplex intersects at most n/r objects. For n pairwise disjoint disks in R(3) and a parameter r is an element of N, we construct a 1/r-cutting of size O(r(2)). For n axis-aligned rectangles in R(3), we construct a 1/r-cutting of size O(r(3/2)). As an application related to multi-point location in three-space, we present tight bounds on the cost of spanning trees across barriers. Given n points and a finite set of disjoint disk barriers in R(3), the points can be connected with a straight line spanning tree such that every disk is stabbed by at most O(root n) edges of the tree. If the barriers are axis-aligned rectangles, then there is a straight line spanning tree such that every rectangle is stabbed by O(n(1/3)) edges. Both bounds are best possible.", "paper_title": "Cuttings for Disks and Axis-Aligned Rectangles in Three-Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000273589700003"}
