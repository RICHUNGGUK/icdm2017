The missing features are imputed based on a group of nearest complete data in the space of residual features of the incomplete data to be recovered. In order to find the complete data points in the space of residual features, an algorithm called the evolutionary Gustafson-Kessel algorithm (EGKA) is proposed that learns the ellipsoid to adaptively cluster the complete data points with the recovered incomplete data points. A linear regression model is utilized to impute the missing features based on the complete data clustered by the ellipsoid learned by the EGKA.", "paper_title": "Imputation of incomplete data using adaptive ellipsoids with linear regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627000023"}
