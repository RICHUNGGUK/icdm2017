Based on a newly developed XML indexing and retrieval system on Okapi, we extend Robertson's field-weighted BM25F for document retrieval to element level retrieval function BM25E. In this paper, we introduce this new function and our experimental method in detail, and then show how we tuned weights for our selected fields by using INEX 2004 topics and assessments. Based on the tuned models we submitted our runs for CO.Thorough, CO.FetchBrowse, the methods we propose show real promise. Existing problems and future work are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Field-weighted XML retrieval based on BM25", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425500012"}
