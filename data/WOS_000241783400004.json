Many human issues may hinder the efforts to accurately capture and clearly understand users' information requirements. In this paper, we review the cognitive underpinnings of some human issues, which are discussed in existing literature and relevant to information requirements determination. We then propose the use of cognitive mapping techniques in the process of information requirements determination. Three widely used cognitive mapping techniques - causal mapping, semantic mapping, and concept mapping - are briefly introduced in this article. A case is used to illustrate how to use these cognitive mapping techniques to supplement Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Unified Process (UP) in information requirements determination. The potential of using cognitive mapping techniques to overcome some cognitive limitations and communication obstacles during information requirements determination is then discussed.", "paper_title": "Using cognitive mapping techniques to supplement UML and UP in information requirements determination", "paper_id": "WOS:000241783400004"}
