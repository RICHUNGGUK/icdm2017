This phase where the biped becomes under-actuated is not present during the walk of humanoid robots. The objective of this Study is to determine if this phase is useful to reduce the energy consumed in the walking. In order to study the efficiency of this phase, six cyclic gaits are presented for a planar biped robot. The simplest cyclic motion is composed of Successive single support phases with flat stance foot on the ground. The most complex cyclic motion is composed of single support phases that include a sub-phase of rotation of the stance foot about the toe and of finite time double support phase. For the synthesis of these walking gaits. optimal motions with respect to the torque cost, are defined by taking into account given performances of actuators. It is shown that for fast motions a foot rotation sub-phase is useful to reduce the criteria cost. In the optimization process, under-actuated phase (foot rotation phase), fully-actuated phase (flat foot phase) and over-actuated phase (double support phase) are considered. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
