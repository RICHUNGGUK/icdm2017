While the technology is already mature, little is known about the internal physical properties. In this paper, we will describe which elements contribute to the charge transport and give an explanation of the steady state current. The contribution of the surfactant molecules to the generation current is proven. For the first time temperature dependent measurements on EPIDs were performed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
