This paper introduces a novel semantic portal, SEMPort, to support the browsing of users based on personalization and enriched semantic hyperlinks. Our semantic portal makes a novel contribution by integrating adaptive hypermedia methods and enriched semantic hyperlinks into semantic portal technologies to provide better navigation. SEMPort supports different personalization such as adaptive link sorting and adaptive link annotation based on interests of individual users. Enriched semantic links are also supplied to guide users to relevant pages. In addition, easy-to-use and real-time content maintenance mechanisms are provided, which is important for the evolution of the content. Evaluations carried out to assess the semantic portal include performance evaluations, interface usability using Nielsen's heuristics and empirical user studies. This paper also provides an overview and comparison to the state-of-the-art as well as outlining future directions for semantic portals.", "paper_title": "A personalized semantic portal for enhanced user support", "paper_id": "WOS:000320359300003"}
