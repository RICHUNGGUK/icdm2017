The splitting method consists of dividing the acoustic problem into a viscous incompressible flow part and an inviscid acoustic part. The incompressible flow equations are solved by a second-order finite volume code EllipSys2D/3D. The acoustic field is obtained by solving a set of acoustic perturbation equations forced by flow quantities. The incompressible pressure and velocity form the input to the acoustic equations. The present work is an extension of our acoustics solver, with the introduction of high-order schemes for spatial discretization and a Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. To achieve low dissipation and dispersion errors, either Dispersion-Relation-Preserving (DRP) schemes or optimized compact finite difference schemes are used for the spatial discretizations. Applications and validations of the new acoustics solver are presented for benchmark aeroacoustic problems and for flow over an NACA 0012 airfoil.
