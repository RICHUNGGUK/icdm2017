Amidst the current scenario of continuously increasing healthcare costs and scarcity of resources, optimal utilization of resources without hampering the quality of care has gained importance in any country. Modelling, analysis and management of patient flows, in this context, plays a key role in performance analysis and improvement of hospital processes as appropriate modelling of patient flows may help healthcare managers make decisions related to capacity planning, resource allocation and scheduling, appointment scheduling and for making necessary changes in the process of care. The concept of patient flow and its modelling has gained much attention in healthcare management literature over past few decades. In this paper, the existing approaches pertaining to modelling of patient flows in hospital systems have been classified and critically appraised focussing on the recent advancements in order to identify future research avenues. A generic framework for patient flow modelling and performance analysis of hospital systems that may serve as a guide for the practitioners dealing with similar kinds of problems to improve healthcare delivery has also been provided.
