These units provide different services such as driver information systems and Internet access. The high speed and high mobility of vehicles make it very challenging to establish and maintain a connection to these units. We introduce a new protocol which uses the characteristics of vehicle movements to predict the future behavior of vehicles, and to select a route with the longest lifetime to connect to the wired network. The proposed protocol aims at spreading the advertisement messages through multi-hops without flooding the network and performing seamless handovers. The proposed protocol is simulated by considering mobility scenarios, generated by the MOVE tool, in the ns-2 simulator tool. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme increases the packet delivery ratio and decreases the packet delay and overhead. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
