Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology using an improved S-shaped membership function has been developed for finding out the \"best candidate FMS alternative\" from a set of candidate-FMSS. The MCDM model trade-offs among various parameters, viz., design parameters, economic considerations, etc., affecting the FMS selection process under multiple, conflicting-in-nature criteria environment. The selection of FMS is made according to the error output of the results found from the proposed MCDM model.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary artificial neural network for selecting flexible manufacturing systems under disparate level-of-satisfaction of decision maker", "paper_id": "WOS:000244011400013"}
