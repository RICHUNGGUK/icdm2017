However, most existing gait tracking systems rely on expensive equipment and take lengthy processes to collect gait data in a dedicated biomechanical environment, limiting their accessibility to small clinics located in remote areas. In this work we propose a new accurate and cost-effective e-healthcare system for fast human gait tracking over wireless networks, where gait data can be collected by using advanced video content analysis techniques with low-cost cameras in a general clinic environment. Furthermore, based on video content analysis, the extracted human motion region is coded, transmitted, and protected in video encoding with a higher priority against the insignificant background area to cope with limited communication bandwidth. In this way the encoder behavior and the modulation and coding scheme are jointly optimized in a holistic way to achieve the best user-perceived video quality over wireless networks. Experimental results using H.264/AVC demonstrate the validity and efficacy of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "A REMOTE MARKERLESS HUMAN GAIT TRACKING FOR E-HEALTHCARE BASED ON CONTENT-AWARE WIRELESS MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274816900009"}
