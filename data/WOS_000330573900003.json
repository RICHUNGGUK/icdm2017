The same circuit is used in the filter and oscillator, which only consists of 2 CDTAs and 2 capacitors. The universal filter can realize low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, band-stop, and all-pass biquad filter functions. With a slight modification of the filter, a new current-mode QO can be obtained easily. The natural frequency and quality factor of the filter and the conditions of oscillation and frequency of oscillation of the QO are all orthogonally adjustable through the bias currents of the CDTAs. Moreover, the passive and active sensitivities of the MISO filter and QO are low. PSpice simulation and experimental results are included to verify the theory.", "paper_title": "Current-mode universal filter and quadrature oscillator using CDTAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000330573900003"}
