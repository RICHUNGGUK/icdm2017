Two types of models are proposed using credibility to measure confidence level. Since the proposed optimization problems are difficult to solve by traditional methods, a fuzzy simulation-based genetic algorithm is applied. Two numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
