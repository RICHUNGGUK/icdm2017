It is use cause is effective and it's cheap. An alternative to this process is the UV disinfection of drinking water. Most of the devices in the market use UV bulbs or mercury lamps. The UV LED, which is cheaper and smaller, allows creating new smaller devices. The main contribution of this paper is the use of Genetic Algorithms to help design a drinking water device with UV LEDs.", "paper_title": "The Use of Genetic Algorithms in UV Disinfection of Drinking Water", "paper_id": "WOS:000362593800006"}
