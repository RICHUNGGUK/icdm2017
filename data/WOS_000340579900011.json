The existence of eigenvalues and the corresponding stationary states lead to partial trapping of the walker in the vicinity of the origin. We analyze the stability of this feature for three-state quantum walks on a line subject to homogenous coin deformations. We find two classes of coin operators that preserve the point spectrum. These new classes of coins are generalizations of coins found previously by different methods and shed light on the rich spectrum of coins that can drive discrete-time quantum walks.", "paper_title": "STABILITY OF POINT SPECTRUM FOR THREE-STATE QUANTUM WALKS ON A LINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579900011"}
