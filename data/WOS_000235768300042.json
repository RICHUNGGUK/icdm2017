We define a new representation called K-plet to encode the local neighborhood of each minutiae. We also present CBFS (Coupled BFS), a new dual graph traversal algorithm for consolidating all the local neighborhood matches and analyze its Computational complexity. The proposed algorithm is robust to non-linear distortion. Ambiguities in minutiae pairings are solved by employing a dynamic programming based optimization approach. We present an experimental evaluation of the proposed approach and showed that it exceeds the performance of the NIST BOZORTH3 [3] matching algorithm.", "paper_title": "K-plet and coupled BFS: A graph based fingerprint representation and matching algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300042"}
