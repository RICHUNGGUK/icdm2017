Two optimization problems are formulated on general Banach spaces, and their solutions are sought: 1) when the transition probability between the signal to be estimated X and the measurement Y or stochastic kernel is unknown, and 2) when the joint probability induced by the random variables (RVs) X, Y is unknown. For both problems, the uncertainty is described by a relative entropy constraint between the unknown distribution and a fixed nominal distribution. The results include existence of the optimal measures using weak* convergence techniques, and properties associated with the estimate of the true distribution. Classical examples are chosen to illustrate the applicability of the results.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Estimation for a Class of Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264632200039"}
