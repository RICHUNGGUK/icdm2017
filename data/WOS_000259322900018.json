RDMS-FFD) inherits some good properties of rational DMS-spline volumes and combines more deformation techniques than previous FFD methods in a consistent framework, such as local deformation, control lattice of arbitrary topology, smooth deformation, multiresolution deformation and direct manipulation of deformation. We First introduce the rational DMS-spline volume by directly generalizing the previous results related to DMS-splines. I-low to generate a tetrahedral domain that, approximates the shape of the object to be deformed is also introduced in this paper. Unlike the traditional FFD techniques, we manipulate tire vertices of the tetrahedral domain to achieve deformation results. Our system demonstrates that RDMS-FFD is powerful and intuitive in geometric modeling.", "paper_title": "Free-form deformation with rational DMS-spline volumes", "paper_id": "WOS:000259322900018"}
