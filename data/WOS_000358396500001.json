Energy consumption can be reduced by not only hardware design but also software design. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware scheduling algorithm with equalized frequency, called EASEF, for parallel applications on heterogeneous computing systems. The EASEF approach aims to minimize the finish time and overall energy consumption. First, EASEF extracts the set of paths from an application. Then, it reconstructs the application based on the extracted set of paths to achieve a reasonable schedule. Finally, it adopts a progressive way to equalize the frequency of tasks to reduce the total energy consumption of systems. Randomly generated applications and two real-world applications are examined in our experiments. Experimental results show that the EASEF algorithm outperforms two existing algorithms in terms of makespan and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware scheduling with reconstruction and frequency equalization on heterogeneous systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000358396500001"}
