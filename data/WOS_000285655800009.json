To ensure a seamless composition, it is often necessary to infer the light conditions of the image to adjust the illumination of the inserted object. Here, we present a novel algorithm for multiple light detection that leverages the limitations of the human visual system (HVS) described in the literature and measured by our own psychophysical study. Finally, we show an application of our method to both image compositing and synthetic object insertion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
