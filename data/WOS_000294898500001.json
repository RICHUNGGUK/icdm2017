Recent studies have shown how to design an optical transport network that supports mixed line rates (MLR), where the wavelength channels of the optical paths (i.e., lightpaths) can have a variety of capacities (10/40/100 Gbps). Some preliminary work on the design of MLR optical networks has already appeared, but survivability, which is a key concern in optical network design, is a nascent topic in MLR networks. This study investigates the problem of protection in MLR optical networks: in particular, we study how to design a cost-effective transparent MLR network that provides dedicated protection at the lightpath level. We propose three mechanisms: MLR-at-p-lightpath protection (MLR-p), MLR-at-lightpath protection (MLR-l), and MLR-with-backup-flow-grooming protection (MLR-g). The design problem is solved by two different approaches: (1) a two-step approach that formulates part of the problem as an integer linear program and (2) a heuristic approach. Our results show that, by appropriate assignment of rates to lightpaths, MLR networks can provide protection for diverse traffic demands with much lower transponder cost compared to single-line-rate networks.", "paper_title": "New Strategies for Connection Protection in Mixed-Line-Rate Optical WDM Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000294898500001"}
