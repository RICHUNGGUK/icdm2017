We present in this paper a Feature Logic based approach to customizable-resources description, selection, and composition. In our approach, resources and requests are both specified in a logical framework by feature terms. The feature terms unification technique allows reasoning on these specifications in order to select and possibly compose the resources that are candidate to satisfy a client request.", "paper_title": "Customizable-resources description, selection, and composition: A feature logic based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000243131600023"}
