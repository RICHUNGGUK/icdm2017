In this paper, by exploiting pair-minutiae vectors, we develop a lightweight, alignment-free scheme for generating cancelable fingerprint templates. The proposed mathematical model is based on a densely infinite-to-one mapping (DITOM) aiming to achieve the non-invertible property. The transformation designed describes the intersection of a collection of hyperplanes and effectively realizes infinite-to-one mapping. The proposed scheme has the properties of non-invertibility, revocability and multiple template independence. Evaluation of the proposed scheme over FVC2002 DB1, DB2 and DB3 shows that the new method exhibits satisfactory performance compared to existing methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
