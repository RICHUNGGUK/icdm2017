However, spaces of images, which are important in the mathematical foundations of vision and pattern recognition, do not fit this framework. This motivates us to develop a version of Hodge theory on metric spaces with a probability measure. We believe that this constitutes a step toward understanding the geometry of vision. Appendix B by Anthony Baker discusses a separable, compact metric space with infinite-dimensional alpha-scale homology.", "paper_title": "Hodge Theory on Metric Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000299524500001"}
