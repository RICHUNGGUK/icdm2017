A local region is represented by its center pixel and a local difference sign-magnitude transform (LDSMT). The center pixels represent the image gray level and they are converted into a binary code, namely CLBP-Center (CLBP_C), by global thresholding. LDSMT decomposes the image local differences into two complementary components: the signs and the magnitudes, and two operators, namely CLBP-Sign (CLBP_S) and CLBP-Magnitude (CLBP_M), are proposed to code them. The traditional LBP is equivalent to the CLBP_S part of CLBP, and we show that CLBP_S preserves more information of the local structure than CLBP_M, which explains why the simple LBP operator can extract the texture features reasonably well. By combining CLBP_S, CLBP_M, and CLBP_C features into joint or hybrid distributions, significant improvement can be made for rotation invariant texture classification.", "paper_title": "A Completed Modeling of Local Binary Pattern Operator for Texture Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000277773200023"}
