The element consists of two cracked zones at the ends and one uncracked zone between the cracked zones. The element has been used to develop a hybrid analytical-numerical procedure for composite bridges. The procedure yields crack lengths and deflections as well as redistributed moments. The procedure would lead to a considerable reduction in the computational effort in the case of continuous steel concrete composite bridges that consist of a large number of spans.
