Lewittes' bound preceded the Geil-Matsumoto bound and it only considers the smallest generator of the numerical semigroup. It can be derived from the Geil-Matsumoto bound and so it is weaker. However, for general semigroups the Geil-Matsumoto bound does not have a closed formula and it may be hard to compute, while Lewittes' bound is very simple. We give a closed formula for the Geil-Matsumoto bound for the case when the Weierstrass semigroup has two generators. We first find a solution to the membership problem for semigroups generated by two integers and then apply it to find the above formula. We also study the semigroups for which Lewittes's bound and the Geil-Matsumoto bound coincide. We finally investigate on some simplifications for the computation of the Geil-Matsumoto bound.", "paper_title": "On the Geil-Matsumoto bound and the length of AG codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200011"}
