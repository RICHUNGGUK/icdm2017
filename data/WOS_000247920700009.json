The first category of approaches merges the different bases into a unique consistent base, and the second category, such as argumentation, accepts inconsistency and copes with it. It is well known that priorities are crucial to solve conflicts. Recently, powerful approaches have been proposed to merge multiple sources information where priorities are either explicitly or implicitly associated to information [L.
