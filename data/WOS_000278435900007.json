This paper presents a reconfigurable BISR (ReBISR) scheme for repairing RAMs with different sizes and redundancy organizations. An efficient redundancy analysis algorithm is proposed to allocate redundancies of defective RAMs. In the ReBISR, a reconfigurable built-in redundancy analysis (ReBIRA) circuit is designed to perform the redundancy algorithm for various RAMs. Also, an adaptively reconfigurable fusing methodology is proposed to reduce the repair setup time when the RAMs are operated in normal mode. Experimental results show that the ReBISR scheme can achieve high repair rate (i.e., the ratio of the number of repaired RAMs to the number of defective RAMs). The area cost of the ReBISR is very small, which is only about 2.7% for four RAMs (one 4 Kbit RAM, one 16 Kbit RAM, one 128 Kbit RAM, and one 512 Kbit RAM). Moreover, the time overhead of redundancy analysis is very small. For example, the ratio of the redundancy analysis time to the test time for a 512 Kbit RAM tested by a March-14N test with solid data backgrounds is only about 0.25%. On the other hand, the proposed fusing scheme can achieve about 86.94% reduction of repair setup time in comparison with a typical fusing scheme for 20 512 x 16 x 64-bit RAMs of which each RAM has one spare row and one spare column.", "paper_title": "ReBISR: A Reconfigurable Built-In Self-Repair Scheme for Random Access Memories in SOCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000278435900007"}
