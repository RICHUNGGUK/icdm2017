At each iteration of a decomposition method, one step of a nonlinear programming scheme is applied to one piece of the MPEC to obtain the next iterate. Our goal is to understand global convergence to B-stationary points of these methods when the embedded nonlinear programming solver is a trust-region scheme, and the selection of pieces is determined using multipliers generated by solving the trust-region subproblem. To this end we study global convergence of a linear trust-region scheme for linearly-constrained NLPs that we call a trust-search method. The trust-search has two features that are critical to global convergence of decomposition methods for MPECs: a robustness property with respect to switching pieces, and a multiplier convergence result that appears to be quite new for trust-region methods. These combine to clarify and strengthen global convergence of decomposition methods without resorting either to additional conditions such as eventual inactivity of the trust-region constraint, or more complex methods that require a separate subproblem for multiplier estimation.", "paper_title": "Multiplier convergence in trust-region methods with application to convergence of decomposition methods for MPECs", "paper_id": "WOS:000251372500004"}
