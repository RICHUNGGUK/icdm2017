It employs two cascaded multiple feedback biquads and active resistors made by quasi-floating gate MOS transistors in triode region for highly linear continuous tuning. Power consumption is strongly reduced using a gain-enhanced class-AB single-stage opamp together with a filter topology that only requires a single opamp for each biquad. The filter has been fabricated in a 0.18 mu m CMOS technology and consumes 290 mu W from a 1.2 V supply.", "paper_title": "Micropower active-RC channel filter for a zero-IF Bluetooth receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000275398000001"}
