The main problems in most multivariate control charts (e.g., T (2) charts, MCUSUM charts, MEWMA charts) are that they cannot give direct information on which variable or subset of variables caused the out-of-control signals. A Decision Tree (DT) learning based model for bivariate process mean shift monitoring and fault identification is proposed in this paper under the assumption of constant variance-covariance matrix. Two DT classifiers based on the C5.0 algorithm are built, one for process monitoring and the other for fault identification. Simulation results show that the proposed model can not only detect the mean shifts but also give information on the variable or subset of variables that cause the out-of-control signals and its/their deviate directions. Finally a bivariate process example is presented and compared with the results of an existing model.", "paper_title": "Online monitoring and fault identification of mean shifts in bivariate processes using decision tree learning techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369800003"}
