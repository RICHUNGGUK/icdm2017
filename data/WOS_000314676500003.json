In this paper, a novel moment-matching-based method has been proposed to accurately extract the probabilistic behavioral distributions of AMS circuits. This method first utilizes Latin hypercube sampling coupling with a correlation control technique to generate a few samples (e. g., sample size is linear with number of variable parameters) and further analytically evaluate the high-order moments of the circuit behavior with high accuracy. In this way, the arbitrary probabilistic distributions of the circuit behavior can be extracted using moment-matching method. More importantly, the proposed method has been successfully applied to high-dimensional problems with linear complexity. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide up to 1666X speedup over crude Monte Carlo method for the same accuracy.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Behavioral Modeling and Analysis for Analog/Mixed-Signal Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000314676500003"}
