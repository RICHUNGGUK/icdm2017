As a key function of automatic control of unmanned cranes, the optimum route can minimize the cycle time by calculating the most efficient combination of horizontal and vertical motions of container loading/unloading. In this study, we have comprehensively studied various issues in the route planning in different fields. Later, the mathematical model based oil the problem analysis of loading/unloading process was presented. Particularly, to solve the problem, an optimum route method based on genetic algorithm, which satisfies the criteria such its length, smooth degree and safety distance, was developed. Finally, the computational experiments testified the effectiveness of the algorithm and explored a new way to increase the efficiency of container loading/unloading process.
