This language balances expressive power and simplicity of use. However, the current version of PSC just represents the order of events and lacks the ability to express timing properties. In real-time systems, it is well known that these timing requirements are very important and need to be specified clearly. Thus, in this paper, we define timed PSC (TPSC) and give the semantics of TPSC in terms of Timed Buchi Automaton (TBA). Then, we measure the expressive power of TPSC based on the recently proposed real-time specification patterns. Finally, we illustrate the use of TPSC in the context of a web service application which requires timing requirements. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
