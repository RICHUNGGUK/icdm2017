The objective is to minimize the maximum time for completing the jobs, or the makespan. The first two steps are inspired by the NEH heuristic, to which a new tie breaking strategy has been incorporated in the insertion phase. Furthermore, the reversibility property of the problem dealt with is taken as a tool for improving the obtained solution. The third step consists of an iterated local search procedure with an embedded local search which is a variant of the non exhaustive descent algorithm. The statistical analysis of the results shows the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
