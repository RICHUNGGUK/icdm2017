New delay-dependent criteria are established for the passivity of MNNs. The time-varying delays of our paper are not necessary to be differentiable, so our results are less conservative, which enrich and improve the earlier publications. An example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
