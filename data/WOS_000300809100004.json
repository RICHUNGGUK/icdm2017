F2 for /1/ is higher utterance initially than utterance finally, more so if the lateral is clear than if it is dark; moreover, the initial and final allophones may be characterized as intrinsic (in most languages/dialects) or extrinsic (in several English dialects, Czech and Dutch) depending on whether the position-dependent frequency difference in question is below or above 200/300 Hz. The paper also reports a larger degree of vowel coarticulation for clear /1/ than for dark /1/ and in initial than in final position. These results are interpreted in terms of the production mechanisms involved in the realization of the two /1/ varieties in the different positional and vowel context conditions subjected to investigation.
