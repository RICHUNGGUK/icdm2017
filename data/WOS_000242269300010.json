The proposed M-ary code selected direct sequence bipolar pulse amplitude modulation scheme can achieve high bit rate without increasing the system bandwidth or changing the pulse shape. With the increase of the modulation level M, the system bit error rate will be improved even at lower signal to noise ratio per bit. The exact bit error probability is derived over the AWGN channel and correlation receivers. Both Monte-Carlo simulation and the theoretical analysis prove the efficiency of this M-ary UWB system.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of a novel M-ary code selected DS-BPAM UWB communication system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242269300010"}
