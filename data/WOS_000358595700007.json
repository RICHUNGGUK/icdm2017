A major challenge is how to analyse the obtained performance results of data transmission for these tools. These challenges include scaling to large networks, testing the correctness and evaluating the performance with the ability to easily migrate to a real system with minimal changes for deployment. Current methods for testing the functions and evaluating the performances of SDN include new programming languages, static analysis and debugging capability, and innovative frameworks of simulation tools. In this paper, we describe the implementation model of OpenFlow system in the INET framework for OMNeT++. The simulation approaches were designed for prototyping and evaluating new SDN-based applications accurately at low cost, while being flexible, scalable, controllable, and accessible to many users. We describe the design and the use of the simulation modules, and demonstrate its capability by carrying out a series of experiments. In addition, we compare the OpenFlow functions of OMNeT++ simulator with the popular Mininet emulator in identical traffic configurations. The measurement results derived from both tools show that they are correct, accurate, and repeatable regarding their capabilities, performance, and functionalities.", "paper_title": "A Comparative Review: Accurate OpenFlow Simulation Tools for Prototyping", "paper_id": "WOS:000358595700007"}
