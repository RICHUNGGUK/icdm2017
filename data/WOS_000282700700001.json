The approximations are based on expansions of the random diffusion coefficients in L(2)(D)-orthogonal bases, and on viewing the coefficients of these expansions as random parameters y=y(omega)=(y(i)(omega)). This yields an equivalent parametric deterministic PDE whose solution u(x,y) is a function of both the space variable x is an element of D and the in general countably many parameters y. We establish new regularity theorems describing the smoothness properties of the solution u as a map from y is an element of U=(-1,1) to V = H(0)(1)(D). These results lead to analytic estimates on the V norms of the coefficients (which are functions of x) in a so-called \"generalized polynomial chaos\" (gpc) expansion of u. Convergence estimates of approximations of u by best N-term truncated V valued polynomials in the variable y is an element of U are established. These estimates are of the form N(-r) , where the rate of convergence r depends only on the decay of the random input expansion. It is shown that r exceeds the benchmark rate 1/2 afforded by Monte Carlo simulations with N \"samples\" (i.e., deterministic solves) under mild smoothness conditions on the random diffusion coefficients. A class of fully discrete approximations is obtained by Galerkin approximation from a hierarchic family {V(l)}(l=0)(infinity) subset of V of finite element spaces in D of the coefficients in the N-term truncated gpc expansions of u(x,y). In contrast to previous works, the level l of spatial resolution is adapted to the gpc coefficient. New regularity theorems describing the smoothness properties of the solution u as a map from y is an element of U=(-1,1)(infinity) to a smoothness space W subset of V are established leading to analytic estimates on the W norms of the gpc coefficients and on their space discretization error. The space W coincides with H(2)(D)boolean AND H(0)(1)(D) in the case where D is a smooth or convex domain. Our analysis shows that in realistic settings a convergence rate N(dof)(-s) in terms of the total number of degrees of freedom N(dof) can be obtained. Here the rate s is determined by both the best N-term approximation rate r and the approximation order of the space discretization in D.", "paper_title": "Convergence Rates of Best N-term Galerkin Approximations for a Class of Elliptic sPDEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000282700700001"}
