In gait analysis, placement of markers to construct an anatomical model has been identified as the single greatest source of error; however, there is currently no standardized approach to quantifying these errors. The current study applies morphometric methods, including a generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) and a nearest neighbour comparison to quantify discrepancies in marker placement, with the goal of improving reliability in gait analysis. An extensive data-set collected by an Expert (n=340) was used to evaluate marker placements performed by a Novice (n=55). Variances identified through principal component analysis were used to create a modified GPA to transform anatomical data, and scaled coordinates from the Novice data-set were then scored against the Expert subset. The results showed quantitative differences in marker placement, suggesting that, although training improved consistency, systematic biases remained.", "paper_title": "A novel method to evaluate error in anatomical marker placement using a modified generalized Procrustes analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000346066300009"}
