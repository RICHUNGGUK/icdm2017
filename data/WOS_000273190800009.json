Relief algorithms are general and successful instance-based feature filtering algorithms for data classification and regression. Many improved Relief algorithms have been introduced as solutions to problems of redundancy and irrelevant noisy features and to the limitations of the algorithms for multiclass datasets. However, these algorithms have only rarely been applied to text classification, because the numerous features in multiclass datasets lead to great time complexity. Therefore, in considering their application to text feature filtering and classification, we presented an extended Relief-F algorithm for numerical attribute estimation (E-Relief-F) in 2007. However. we found limitations and some problems with it. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce additional problems with Relief algorithms for text feature filtering, including the negative influence of computation similarities and weights caused by a small number of features in an instance, the absence of nearest hits and misses for some instances, and great time complexity. We then suggest a new extended Relief-F algorithm for nominal attribute estimation (E-Relief-Fd) to solve these problems, and we apply it to small text-document classification. We used the algorithm in experiments to estimate feature quality for various datasets, its application to classification, and its performance in comparison with existing Relief algorithms. The experimental results show that the new E-Relief-Fd algorithm offers better performance than previous Relief algorithms. including E-Relief-F.", "paper_title": "Extended Relief-F Algorithm for Nominal Attribute Estimation in Small-Document Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190800009"}
