Compared with the existent general models, the proposed time- and position-dependent model simultaneously covers the normal and actual processing cases. Moreover, the model has many new properties that the previous work did not study. In this paper, a distinctive proof technique is developed based on the adding-and-subtracting-terms operation and the Lagrange Mean Value Theorem. The proof technique is easier to use than the method based on multiple identical or similar lemmas employed in a large number of literatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
