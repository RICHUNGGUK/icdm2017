The error characteristics of the vision based state estimation and the associated uncertainty of the control are investigated. The major contribution is the analysis of the propagation of image error through pose estimation and visual servoing control law. Using the analysis, two classical visual servoing methods are evaluated: position-based and 2.5D visual servoing. The evaluation offers a tool to build and analyze hybrid control systems such as switching or partitioning control. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
