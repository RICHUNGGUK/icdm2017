Under a widely-used control policy for this type of inventory system, the objective is to find the optimal number of replenishments, their timings and their respective order-up-to-levels that meet customer demands to a required service level. We extend a known CP approach for this problem using three cost-based filtering methods. Our approach can solve to optimality instances of realistic size much more efficiently than previous approaches, often with no search effort at all.", "paper_title": "Cost-Based Filtering Techniques for Stochastic Inventory Control Under Service Level Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000264319700001"}
