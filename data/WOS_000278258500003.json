To better understand these sites, we modeled axon recruitment by coupling stimulation-induced electric potential fields to biophysical models of CA3 axon arbors in mouse hippocampal brain slices. Geometrically realistic CA3 axon arbors were generated from prior anatomic observations. For single electrode stimulation, 95% of initiation sites were no further than 135 mu m away and propagation sites were no further than 875 mu m. Using dual electrode stimulation, additional axon arbor pieces were recruited, an effect that increased with distance between stimulating electrodes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
