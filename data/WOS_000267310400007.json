The definition of each of these functions suggests a natural way in which to strengthen them, which also captures Tutte's universal V-function as a specialization. We show that the equivalence remains true for the strong functions, thus answering a question raised by Dominic Welsh.", "paper_title": "The Equivalence of Two Graph Polynomials and a Symmetric Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000267310400007"}
