Some of these particles are formed by conformers of H2O, HNO3, and H2SO4. We carried out calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to obtain optimized structures. Several stable trimers are achieved-divided in two groups, one with HNO3 moiety, second with H2SO4 moiety-after pre-optimization at B3LYP/6-31G and subsequently optimization at B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. For both most stable conformers five H2O molecules are added to their optimized trimers to calculate hydrated geometries. The OH stretching harmonic frequencies are provided for all aggregates. The zero-point energy correction (ZEPC), relative electronic energies (Delta E), relative reaction Gibbs free energies Delta(Delta G)(k-relative), and cooling constant (K-cooling) are reported at three temperatures: 188 K, 195 K, and 210 K. Shapes given in our calculations are compared with various experimental shapes as well as comparisons with their thermostabilities.", "paper_title": "Facet shapes and thermo-stabilities of H2SO4 center dot HNO3 hydrates involved in polar stratospheric clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000360850900019"}
