We have performed calculations for two series of random perturbations to the atomic coordinates perpendicular to the Fe/MgO interface, and report on the effects of such random variations of the structure on the calculated conductance. We find that the variations lead to significant differences in conductance.", "paper_title": "Electronic transport in crystalline magnetotunnel junctions: effects of structural disorder", "paper_id": "WOS:000244983100017"}
