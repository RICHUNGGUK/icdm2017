However, an aspect of this problem that is commonly neglected in practice is the potentially confounding effect of drivers re-routing in response to changes in travel times on competing routes, brought about by the changes to the signal timings. This article considers the problem of optimizing signal green and cycle timings over an urban network, in such a way that the optimization anticipates the impact on traffic routing patterns. This is achieved by including a network equilibrium model as a constraint to the optimization. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is devised for solving the resulting problem, using total travel time across the network as an illustrative fitness function, and with a widely used traffic simulation-assignment model providing the equilibrium flows. The procedure is applied to a case study of the city of Chester in the UK, and the performance of the algorithms is analyzed with respect to the parameters of the GA method. The results show a better performance of the signal timing as optimized by the GA method as compared to a method that does not consider rerouting. This improvement is found to be more significant with a more congested network whereas under a relatively mild congestion situation the improvement is not very clear.", "paper_title": "A genetic algorithm approach for optimizing traffic control signals considering routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000242016500004"}
