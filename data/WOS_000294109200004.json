A recursive algorithm for calculating an ellipsoid which always contains the state is developed. In the prediction step, a predicted state ellipsoid is determined; in the update step, a state estimation ellipsoid is computed by combining the predicted state ellipsoid and the set of states compatible with the measurement equation. A smallest possible estimate set is calculated recursively by solving the semi-definite programming problems. Hence, the proposed set-membership filter relies on a two-step prediction-correction structure, which is similar to the Kalman filter. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Set-membership filtering for polytopic uncertain discrete-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000294109200004"}
