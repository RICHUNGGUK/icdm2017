Unlike most works in the literature which mainly rely on classical frequency and energy based features along with a single global classifier for emotion recognition, we propose in this paper some new harmonic and Zipf based features for better speech emotion characterization in the valence dimension and a multi-stage classification scheme driven by a dimensional emotion model for better emotional class discrimination. Experimented on the Berlin dataset with 68 features and six emotion states, our approach shows its effectiveness, displaying a 68.60% classification rate and reaching a 71.52% classification rate when a gender classification is first applied. Using the DES dataset with five emotion states, our approach achieves an 81% recognition rate when the best performance in the literature to our knowledge is 76.15% on the same dataset.", "paper_title": "Multi-stage classification of emotional speech motivated by a dimensional emotion model", "paper_id": "WOS:000273093600006"}
