However, the complex architecture and heavy computing demands of such systems increase power consumption. Therefore, energy conservation has become a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel tasks scheduling algorithm for real-time multiprocessor systems. The algorithm works by reducing the workload in high speed processors with the aid of task migration so that the entire system can switch to low speed/low voltage as soon as it can reduce power consumption. The overhead of transitioning to low voltage is also analyzed and used as a criterion to determine whether the transition is beneficial. The effect of important parameters such as task granularity on the performance is also investigated, and simulation results based on realistic processor power consumption models are shown to be promising.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient tasks scheduling algorithm for real-time multiprocessor embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000309353800021"}
