The idea is to treat email address as a data owned by the addressee, and any use of the data (that is, to send messages to the addressee) must be authorized by the person through the issue of licenses. Subject to laws, an email license (EL) represents a legal agreement between the sender and the recipient upon what type of messages can be delivered, and in what restrictions. EL also enables commercial email senders to adopt a more constructive and legitimate approach to deliver their emails by negotiating with and crediting their customers in reading their emails.
