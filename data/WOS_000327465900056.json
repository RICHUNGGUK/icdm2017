The security issues of smart devices attract more and more attention. In our work, the communication protocol, storage mechanism and authentication of smart devices are analyzed and a tool box is developed to evaluate the security risks of smart devices. In this demo, our tool box is applied to scan 3 smart meters/power monitor systems. A potential risk list is generated and the vulnerabilities are further verified.", "paper_title": "Security Risks Evaluation Toolbox for Smart Grid Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900056"}
