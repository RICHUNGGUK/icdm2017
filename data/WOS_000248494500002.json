Organs and body Parts were assumed to be likened to cylindrically shaped porous media, so-called pseudo-organs, and treated in the computational domain as forms of hemodynamic resistance. Permeability functions were determined from two-dimensional axisymmetric computations of each aortic branch and these functions were then used in an unsteady three-dimensional simulation of the complete aorta. Substantially accurate cardiac output (5.91 L/min) and blood distributions to the major branches were predicted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
