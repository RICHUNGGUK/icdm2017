Dynamic system components are represented by partial reconfiguration (PR) modules. In comparison to a static system, the design of a partially reconfigurable system requires additional design steps, such as partitioning the device resources into static and dynamic regions. We present the concept of tiled PR regions, which enables a flexible online-placement of PR modules. Dynamic reconfiguration requires a suitable communication infrastructure to interconnect the static and dynamic system components. We present an embedded communication macro, a communication infrastructure that interconnects PR modules in a tiled PR region. Efficient online-placement of PR modules depends not only on the placement algorithm, but also on design-time aspects such as the chosen synthesis regions of the PR modules. We propose a design method for selecting suitable synthesis regions for the PR modules aiming to optimize their placement at run-time.", "paper_title": "Design Optimizations for Tiled Partially Reconfigurable Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290998700011"}
