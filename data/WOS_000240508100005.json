For the detection of faults, a quantitative criterion is developed by comparing the innovation process errors occurring in the Kalman filter estimation algorithm, which, for faulty system recovery, a weighting matrix resetting technique is developed by adjusting and resetting the covariance matrices of the parameter estimate obtained in the Kalman filter estimation algorithm to improve the parameter estimation of the faulty systems. The proposed method can effectively cope with partially abrupt and/ or gradual system faults and/ or input failures with fault detection. The modified state- space self- tuning control scheme can be applied to the multivariable stochastic faulty system without requiring prior knowledge of system parameters and noise properties.", "paper_title": "Active fault tolerant control using state-space self-tuning control approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000240508100005"}
