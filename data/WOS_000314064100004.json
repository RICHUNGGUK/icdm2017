This work describes the strategy developed by the IMI eTOX consortium for identifying and compiling data and other related resources from the biomedical literature and a wide spectrum of public on-line sources. The main result of this effort is a large web-based structured library containing links to articles of toxicological relevance (data that can be used for modeling purposes, computational models, and toxicity mechanisms), public databases, standardized vocabularies and modeling tools. All this material has been manually reviewed, systematically evaluated and grouped into different categories. The library has been made public at the eTOX website (http://www.etoxproject.eu/), where it is updated on a monthly basis, constituting a useful resource for affording the in silico toxicity prediction of novel drug candidates.", "paper_title": "The eTOX Library of Public Resources for in Silico Toxicity Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000314064100004"}
