Its usefulness is demonstrated quantitatively in a Monte-Carlo simulation on critical steps in a origin of life model. The model describes the origin of a bio-like genetic apparatus by a long sequence of physical-chemical steps: it starts with the presence of a self-replicating oligomer and a specifically structured environment in time and space that allow for the formation of aggregates such as assembler-hairpins-devices and, at a later stage, an assembler-hairpins-enzyme device-a first translation machine.", "paper_title": "An information-carrying and knowledge-producing molecular machine.
