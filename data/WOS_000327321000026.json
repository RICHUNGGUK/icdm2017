The ILFD uses two concurrent injection mechanisms with two independent push-push circuits to extend the locking range. It is realized with a cross-coupled n-core MOS LC-tank oscillator. The core power consumption of the ILFD core is 11.496 mW. The divider's free-running oscillation frequency is tunable from 4.32 to 3.78 GHz by tuning the varactor's control bias, and at the incident power of 0 dBm the maximum locking range is 3 GHz (25 %), from the incident frequency 10.5 to 13.5 GHz. The operation range is 3.6 GHz (30.76 %), from 9.9 to 13.5 GHz.", "paper_title": "A wide-locking range divided by 3 injection-locked frequency divider using concurrent injection mechanisms", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000026"}
