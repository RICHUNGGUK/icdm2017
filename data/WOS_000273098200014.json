It is shown that the phase noise of a tunable filter is dependent on the input power, fractional bandwidth, filter order, resonator quality factor, and tuning state. Phase noise is higher for filters with smaller fractional bandwidth. In filters with high fractional bandwidth (>3%), phase noise increases as the input power approaches the power-handling capability of the filter. In filters with smaller bandwidths, phase noise increases with input power upto a threshold level of input power, but begins to decrease thereafter. The unloaded quality factor of the filter has a noticeable effect on the phase noise of filters with narrow bandwidths. The phase noise changes with the filter tuning state and is maximum when all the switches are in the upstate position. It is also shown that the phase noise increases with the filter order, due to increase in the number of noisy elements in the filter structure. This article provides a methodology to evaluate the phase noise of a tunable filter and proves that RF MEMS filters are suitable for high performance applications without considerable phase-noise penalty.
