Some of them even evade stepping-stone detection by conducting manipulations. Most of the approaches proposed to detect stepping-stone are vulnerable in detecting intruders' evasion, such as time perturbation, and chaff perturbation. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to detect stepping-stone by comparing the self and cross packet matching rates of a session. ne analysis and simulation results show that this algorithm detects not only stepping-stone without misdetection, but also intruder's evasion with less limitation. It can resist to intruders' time perturbation completely, as well as chaff perturbation.", "paper_title": "Resistance analysis to intruders' evasion of a novel algorithm to detect stepping-stone", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800046"}
