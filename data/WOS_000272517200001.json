Design/methodology/approach - A total of 16 international students of the University of Sheffield were interviewed in July 2008 to explore their preferences among potential features in next generation OPACs. A semi-structured interview schedule with images of mock-up screens was used. Findings - The results of the interviews were broadly consistent with previous studies. In general, students expect features in next generation OPACs should save their time, be easy to use and relevant to their search. This study found that recommender features and features that can provide better navigation of search results are desired by users. However, Web 2.0 features, such as RSS feeds and those features which involved user participation were among the least popular. Practical implications - This paper produces findings of relevance to any academic library seeking to implement a next-generation OPAC. Originality/value - There have been no previous published research studies of users' preferences among possible features of next-generation OPACs.", "paper_title": "Student user preferences for features of next-generation OPACs A case study of University of Sheffield international students", "paper_id": "WOS:000272517200001"}
