The proposed approaches resolve the bottle-neck problem of conventional HPDIM and significantly improve computational efficiency of both PEM and HPDIM, making the proposed nonstationary stochastic analysis scheme more attractive for engineering purposes. Hence, it has been implemented in general finite element platforms, having powerful and versatile modelling and analysis capabilities, for stochastic seismic analysis of large and complex structures under tridirectional nonstationary spatial seismic motions.
