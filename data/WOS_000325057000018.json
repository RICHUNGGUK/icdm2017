Numerical analyses and analytical calculations are presented for various pile spacings and pile-soil adhesion factors. The numerical results are shown to be in excellent agreement with each other and also with the theoretical upper bounds produced by the analytical upper bound calculations. Based on the numerical and analytical results, an empirical equation is proposed for the calculation of the ultimate undrained lateral bearing capacity factor. This equation is subsequently used to calculate p-multipliers applicable to the lower part of piles in pile rows, which are compared to multipliers available in the literature (that are constant with depth). The comparison shows significant differences, indicating that the amount of reduction in lateral resistance due to group effects is not constant with depth as routinely assumed in practice.
