This combination incorporates DE algorithm into the optimization procedure of BBO with an attempt to incorporate diversity to overcome stagnation at local optima. We also propose to implement an additional selection procedure for BBO, which preserves fitter habitats for subsequent generations. The proposed variation of BBO, named DBBO, is tested for several benchmark function optimization problems. The results show that DBBO can significantly outperform the basic BBO algorithm and can mostly emerge as the best solution providing algorithm among competing BBO and DE algorithms.
