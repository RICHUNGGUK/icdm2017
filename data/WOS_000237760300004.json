Evaluation of recycling cost and benefit of reclaimed materials as well as selection of recycling strategy is essential for not only product designers but recycling policy makers. This study proposes an intelligent evaluation approach that incorporates case-based reasoning models, economic analysis model and domain expertise. Case-based reasoning method is used to determine recycling strategy and performance of disassembly operation while economic analysis model is used for quick estimating recycling cost and benefit. Domain expertise is adopted in model parameter estimation to facilitate the computation. The approach can be used both as a module of design for recycling in eco-design evaluation and as an independent evaluation tool for recycling policy making. Illustrative examples are included to depict the application potential. Advantages and drawback are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
