Consequently, the spatial disorientation has become a significant problem for older people and their caregivers. The ambient-assisted living applications are offering location-based services for empowering elderly to go outside and encouraging a greater independence. Therefore, this paper describes the design and technical evaluation of a location-awareness service enabler aimed at supporting and managing probable wandering situations of a person with MCI. Through the presence capabilities of the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) architecture, the service will alert patient's contacts if a hazardous situation is detected depending on his location. Furthermore, information about the older person's security areas has been included in the user profile managed by IMS. In doing so, the service enabler introduced contribute to \"contextawareness\" paradigm allowing the adaptation and personalization of services depending on user's context and specific conditions or preferences.", "paper_title": "Design and Technical Evaluation of an Enhanced Location-Awareness Service Enabler for Spatial Disorientation Management of Elderly With Mild Cognitive Impairment", "paper_id": "WOS:000347342300004"}
