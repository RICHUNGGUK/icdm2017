However, they are inconvenient for Bayesian inference because it is hard to find their normalization constant in closed form. In this paper, a new Bayesian algorithm is proposed for the image restoration problem that bypasses this difficulty. An image prior is defined by imposing Student-t densities on the outputs of local convolutional filters. A variational methodology, with a constrained expectation step, is used to infer the restored image. Numerical experiments are shown that compare this methodology to previous ones and demonstrate its advantages.", "paper_title": "Variational Bayesian image restoration based on a product of t-distributions image prior", "paper_id": "WOS:000259372100005"}
