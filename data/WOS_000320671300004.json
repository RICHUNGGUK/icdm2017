Wavelength reconfigurability is an instrument that can enable such capability of network-wide bandwidth redistribution since it allows dynamic sharing of both wavelengths and timeslots in WDM-TDM optical access networks. However, reconfigurability typically requires tunable lasers and tunable filters at the user side, resulting in cost-prohibitive optical network units (ONUs). In this paper, we propose a novel concept, named cyclic-linked flexibility, to address the cost-prohibitive problem. By using cyclic-linked flexibility, the ONU needs to switch only within a subset of two preplanned wavelengths, but the cyclic-linked structure of wavelengths allows free bandwidth to be shifted to any wavelength by a rearrangement process. A basic rearrangement algorithm is developed to demonstrate that cyclic-linked flexibility performs close to a fully flexible network in terms of blocking probability, packet delay, and packet loss. Furthermore, we show that the rearrangement process has minimum impact on in-service ONUs. To realize cyclic-linked flexibility, a physical implementation is proposed with a feasible cost and wavelength-agnostic ONU design.", "paper_title": "Cyclic-Linked Flexibility: An Architectural Approach for Reconfigurable Optical WDM-TDM Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320671300004"}
