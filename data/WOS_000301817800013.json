Let r(G) be the radius of G. We prove that for any connected graph G of maximum degree four which is not a path with even number of vertices, R(G) >= r(G). As a consequence, we resolve the conjecture R(G) >= r(G) - 1 given by Fajtlowicz in 1988 for the case when G is a chemical graph.", "paper_title": "On the Inequality between Radius and Randic Index for Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000301817800013"}
