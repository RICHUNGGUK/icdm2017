In the first phase, a set of suspected faulty sites is obtained by applying an approach based on an Effect-Cause analysis. Then, in the second phase, a set of realistic fault models is associated with each suspected faulty site by analyzing specific information, called fault evidences, collected during the first phase. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is its capability to deal with several fault models at the same time. Another advantage is that it is able to handle both single and multiple fault occurrences. Experiments on ISCAS85, ISCAS89, and ITC99 benchmark circuits show the efficiency of the proposed method both in terms of diagnosis resolution and accuracy of the predicted fault models.", "paper_title": "A Comprehensive Framework for Logic Diagnosis of Arbitrary Defects", "paper_id": "WOS:000273707200001"}
