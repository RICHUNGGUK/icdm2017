Depending on the treatment one wants to apply to duplicate genes, Blin et al. introduced three models to define nested common intervals of two sequences: the uniqueness, the free-inclusion, and the bijection models. We consider all the three models. For the uniqueness and the bijection models, we give O(n + N-out)-time algorithms, where N-out denotes the size of the output. For the free-inclusion model, we give an O(n(1+epsilon) + N-out)-time algorithm, where epsilon > 0 is an arbitrarily small constant. We also present an upper bound on the size of the output for each model. For the uniqueness and the free-inclusion models, we show that N-out = O(n(2)). Let C = Sigma(g epsilon Gamma) o(1)(g)o(2)(g), where Gamma is the set of distinct genes, and o(1)(g) and o(2)(g) are, respectively, the numbers of copies of g in the two given sequences. For the bijection model, we show that N-out = O(Cn). In this paper, we also study the problem of finding all approximate nested common intervals of two sequences on the bijection model. An O(delta n + N-out)-time algorithm is presented, where delta denotes the maximum number of allowed gaps. In addition, we show that for this problem N-out is O(delta n(3)).", "paper_title": "Output-Sensitive Algorithms for Finding the Nested Common Intervals of Two General Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000299560500020"}
