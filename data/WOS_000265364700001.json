This paper introduces an integrated mechatronic approach for the systematic design and operation of flexible, sensorless, automated micromanipulation for a variety of microparts on microactuation arrays. This approach is a mechatronic synthesis of methods from different engineering areas such as solid modeling, electronics design, software for control and programming of mechanical actuation. It involves designing of programmable force fields for manipulation of convex or non-convex polygonal microparts on an array, hardware programmable circuitry for the activation of the array and a software algorithmic procedure for the programming. A detailed analysis is given, as well as several simulated experiments performed using the introduced approach on a cilia microactuator array for a variety of polygonal asymmetric and non-convex microparts and the results are presented and discussed. Finally, the advantages and limitations of this approach are analyzed and points for further research are raised. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
