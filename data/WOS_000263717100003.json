To explain the observed phenomena, it is proposed that the orientational ordering of charged plasma proteins induces attractive interaction between two like-charged liposome surfaces in close contact. It is observed that the encapsulation of the spherical liposome is possible only if the membrane of the target liposome is flexible enough to adapt its shape to the shape of the spherical liposome. In the theoretical model, the shapes of the two agglutinated liposomes are determined by minimisation of the sum of the adhesion energy and the membrane elastic energy. In the simulations, the membrane of liposomes is considered as an elastic structure and discretised via the finite element method using spring elements. It is shown that the observed agglutination of liposomes and encapsulation of smaller spherical liposomes into larger flaccid liposomes may be explained as a competition between the membrane deformation energy and the membrane adhesion energy.", "paper_title": "Encapsulation of small spherical liposome into larger flaccid liposome induced by human plasma proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000263717100003"}
