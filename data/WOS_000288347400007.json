Fuzzy logic is a powerful tool to solve many image processing problems because of its ability to deal with ambiguous data. In this paper, we use a similarity measure based on fuzzy correlations in order to establish the corner correspondence between sequence images in the presence of intensity variations and motion blur. The matching approach proposed here needs only to extract one set of corner points as candidates from the left image (first frame), and the positions of which in the right image (second frame) are determined by matching, not by extracting. Experiments conducted with the help of various sequences of images prove the superiority of our algorithm over standard and zero-mean cross correlation as well as one contemporary work using mutual information as a window similarity measure combined with graph matching techniques under non-ideal conditions.
