We show that several other results from the literature, already known to characterize surjective cellular automata in dimension d, hold precisely when the Garden-of-Eden theorem does. We focus in particular on the balancedness theorem, which has been proven by Bartholdi to fail on amenable groups, and we measure the amount of such failure.", "paper_title": "Surjective cellular automata far from the Garden of Eden", "paper_id": "WOS:000327036900005"}
