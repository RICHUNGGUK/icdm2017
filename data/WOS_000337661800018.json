The retarded, neutral and distributed delays are considered to be interval mode-dependent and time-varying, while the sampling period is assumed to be time-varying and bounded. By the interval dividing approach, a new augmented stochastic Lyapunov functional is constructed, which contains some triple-integral terms to reduce the conservativeness. Then the delay-range-dependent and rate-dependent exponential stability conditions for the closed-loop error system are obtained by the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, integral matrix inequalities and reciprocally convex lemma. Based on these new stability conditions, the sampled-data exponential synchronization controllers are found in terms of the solutions to linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed theoretic result. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
