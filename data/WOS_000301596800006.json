In this study, we estimate stress transfer properties of four commercial implants (GMI, Lifecore, Intri and Avinent) that differ significantly in macroscopic geometry. Detailed three-dimensional finite element models were adopted to analyse the behaviour of the bone-implant system depending on the geometry of the implant (two different diameters) and the bone-implant interface condition. Occlusal static forces were applied and their effects on the bone, implant and bone-implant interface were evaluated. Large diameters avoided overload-induced bone resorption. Higher stresses were obtained with a debonded bone-implant interface. Relative micromotions at the bone-implant interface were within the limits required to achieve a good osseointegration. We anticipate that the methodology proposed may be a useful tool for a quantitative and qualitative comparison between different commercial dental implants.", "paper_title": "Stress transfer properties of different commercial dental implants: a finite element study", "paper_id": "WOS:000301596800006"}
