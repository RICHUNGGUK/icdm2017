Process modelling yields a set of mass balance partial differential equations describing the evolution of the component concentrations along the biofilter. Based on sets of experimental data collected over several months, unknown model parameters are estimated by minimizing an output-error criterion. The resulting distributed parameter model and a few pointwise measurements of nitrate, nitrite, and ethanol concentrations are then used to design observers allowing the unmeasured biomass concentrations to be reconstructed on-line. First, it is demonstrated that asymptotic observers are not applicable to the given model structure. Then, a receding-horizon observer is designed and tested, showing a very satisfactory performance.", "paper_title": "Transient analysis of a wastewater treatment biofilter - distributed parameter modelling and state estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239452300005"}
