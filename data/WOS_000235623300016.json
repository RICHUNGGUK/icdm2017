Using this result, it is shown that built-in test-pattern generation for scan circuits can be based on transition probabilities, instead of probabilities of specific bits in the test set being 0 or 1. The resulting approach associates only two parameters with every set of test vectors: an initial value and a transition probability. It is demonstrated that this approach is effective in detecting all the detectable single stuck-at faults in benchmark circuits. The case where the circuit has a single scan chain, and the case where the circuit has multiple scan chains are considered.", "paper_title": "Scan-BIST based on transition probabilities for circuits with single and multiple scan chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000235623300016"}
