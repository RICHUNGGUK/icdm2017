Several semantics of negation are explored w.r.t. the deduction problem and the query answering problem. Sound and complete algorithm schemes based on projection (or coref-projection) are provided in all cases. The processing of equality/inequality is added to the framework.", "paper_title": "Simple conceptual graphs with atomic negation and difference", "paper_id": "WOS:000239625500023"}
