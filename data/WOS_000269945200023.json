The electro-thermal model is constructed using system dynamics. The system model, in which the electrical and the thermal domain are combined, is presented. The developed model describes the dynamic thermal behavior system that was an electronic device in the test enclosure. An effective way to identify the thermal parameters of the system, especially the thermal contact resistance, is suggested. In detail, the new method for thermal resistance identification is based on the temperature difference behavior between the component and the air temperature inside the enclosure. Based on the proposed model, either the variation of the heat source or the ambient temperature can be estimated. Simulated results were in good agreement with the measured temperature in the transient state accompanying with the variation of the environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
