Based on a thorough experimental analysis of reactive tabu search applications to the quadratic assignment and the maximum clique problem, we show that its performance is relatively insensitive to its meta-parameters. This is particularly evident when compared to the sensitivity of tabu search to its parameters: tabu search is rather penalized if used with sub-optimal parameter settings. Reactive tabu search does not strongly pay its high parameter robustness in terms of performance, although it does not improve the peak performance of tabu search.", "paper_title": "On the sensitivity of reactive tabu search to its meta-parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000343889900008"}
