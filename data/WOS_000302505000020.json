In contrast to classical logic, the validity and the satisfiability problems of G(infinity)(Delta) are not directly dual to each other. We nevertheless provide a uniform, computational treatment of both problems for prenex formulas by describing appropriate translations into sets of order clauses that can be subjected to chaining resolution. For validity a version of Herbrand's Theorem allows us to show the soundness of standard Skolemization. For satisfiability the translation involves a novel, extended Skolemization method.", "paper_title": "THEOREM PROVING FOR PRENEX GODEL LOGIC WITH Delta: CHECKING VALIDITY AND UNSATISFIABILITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000302505000020"}
