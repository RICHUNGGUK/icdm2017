The KNN NPs and MW-CNTs are dispersed in polydimethylsioxane by mechanical agitation to produce a piezoelectric nanocomposite device. The device exhibits an output voltage of approximately 30 V and output current of approximately 15 mu A. Furthermore, the device exhibits potential as a self-powered pressure sensor because the output voltage can be tested to detect the pressure applied to the device and does not require other sources.", "paper_title": "K0.5Na0.5NbO3-Based Self-Powered Pressure Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000364491600005"}
