We also investigate the possibility of reducing test set length, maintaining fault coverage, by performing a tradeoff between test set volume and power. Experiments on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits validate effectiveness of our work. We could achieve an average reduction of 84.78% in dynamic power and 6.52% in leakage power for pattern set generated by the ATPG tool Atalanta. Similar savings could also be achieved on test set generated by the commercial ATPG tool Tetramax. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
