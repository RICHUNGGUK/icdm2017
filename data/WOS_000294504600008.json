Spread spectrum (SS) technique has developed rapidly in this area due to the advantages of good robustness and immunity to noise attack. Accordingly detecting the SS hiding effectively and verifying the presence of the secrete message are important issues. In this paper we present two steganalysis algorithms for SS hiding. Both the two methods are based on machine learning theory and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In the algorithm I, we introduce Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and generalize Gaussian distribution (GGD) to character the probability distribution of wavelet sub-band. Then the absolute probability distribution function (PDF) moment is extracted as feature vectors. In the algorithm II, we propose distance metric between GMM and GGD of wavelet sub-band to distinguish cover and stego audio. Four distance metrics (Kullback-Leibler Distance, Bhattacharyya Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, L2 Distance) are calculated as feature vectors. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier is utilized for classification. The experiment results of both two proposed algorithms can achieve better detecting performance. Even when embedding strength gets 0.0005, the correct detection rate can reach up to 90%. Its simplicity and extensibility indicate further application in other audio steganalysis.", "paper_title": "Audio steganalysis of spread spectrum information hiding based on statistical moment and distance metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000294504600008"}
