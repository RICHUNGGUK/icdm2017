This was one of the open challenges concerning disjoint paths, explicitly asked by Muller (Math Program 105 (2-3):275-288, 2006). It also strengthens Schwarzler's recent proof of one of the open problems of Schrijver's book (Combinatorial Optimization: Polyhedra and Efficiency. Springer, Berlin 2003), about the complexity of the edge-disjoint paths problem with terminals on the outer boundary of a planar graph. We also give a directed acyclic reduction. This proves that the arc-disjoint paths problem is NP-complete in directed acyclic graphs, even with only two classes of demand arcs.", "paper_title": "The hardness of routing two pairs on one face", "paper_id": "WOS:000299180900003"}
