Through the Internet, providers can offer their products directly to consumers, which increase their choices and allow them to contract a set of different services/products from different providers. But sometimes the consumer needs an all-or-nothing exchange with these providers: an atomic exchange. The consumer has negotiated/obtained a set of conditions that are only met if she acquires all the services/products. Thus, we need an Atomic Multi-Two-Party contract signing protocol. Even though digital signature of contracts is a topic that has been widely studied, it lacks a solution when applied to Atomic Multi-Two-Party scenarios. Here, we propose the first solution to solve this problem.", "paper_title": "An Asynchronous Optimistic Protocol for Atomic Multi-Two-Party Contract Signing", "paper_id": "WOS:000325489800010"}
