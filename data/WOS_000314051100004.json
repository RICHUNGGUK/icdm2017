The issue of privacy is of serious concern for applying the Pub/Sub to ubiquitous computing. The design of the privacy mechanism should consider the required efficiency of event dissemination in the underlying Pub/Sub middleware. In this paper, we address these challenges among ubiquitous applications by applying the proposed privacy-aware Pub/Sub middleware, which provides high performance and scalability with parameterised and prioritised attributes. It is able to provide fast and dynamic privacy management with low extra overhead.", "paper_title": "An efficient privacy preserving Pub-Sub system for ubiquitous computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051100004"}
