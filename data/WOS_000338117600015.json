The algorithm is an implementation of the unified framework for list decoding of algebraic codes of Guruswami, Sahai and Sudan (Proceedings of the 41st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2000), specialised for number field codes. The computational complexity of the algorithm is evaluated in terms of the size of the inputs and field invariants.", "paper_title": "List decoding of number field codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000338117600015"}
