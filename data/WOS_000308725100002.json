This paper proposes a new formulation of these multi-objective ant colony optimization (MOACO) algorithms. This formulation is based on adding specific algorithm components for tackling multiple objectives to the basic ACO metaheuristic. Examples of these components are how to represent multiple objectives using pheromone and heuristic information, how to select the best solutions for updating the pheromone information, and how to define and use weights to aggregate the different objectives. This formulation reveals more similarities than previously thought in the design choices made in existing MOACO algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is an experimental analysis of how particular design choices affect the quality and the shape of the Pareto front approximations generated by each MOACO algorithm. This study provides general guidelines to understand how MOACO algorithms work, and how to improve their design.", "paper_title": "An experimental analysis of design choices of multi-objective ant colony optimization algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000308725100002"}
