Electronic documents produced by scanning and OCR software contain recognition errors. This paper uses an automatic approach to examine the selection and the effectiveness of searching techniques for possible erroneous terms for query expansion. The proposed method consists of two basic steps. In the first step, confused characters in erroneous words are located and editing operations are applied to create a collection of erroneous error-grams in the basic unit of the model. The second step uses query terms and error-grams to generate additional query terms, identify appropriate matching terms, and determine the degree of relevance of retrieved document images to the user's query, based on a vector space IR model. The proposed approach has been trained on 979 document images to construct about 2,822 error-grams and tested on 100 scanned Web pages, 200 advertisements and manuals, and 700 degraded images. The performance of our method is evaluated experimentally by determining retrieval effectiveness with respect to recall and precision. The results obtained show its effectiveness and indicate an improvement over standard methods such as vectorial systems without expanded query and 3-gram overlapping.", "paper_title": "Retrieving poorly degraded OCR documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000247587000002"}
