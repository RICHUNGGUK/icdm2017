Several strategies have been proposed for ranking Fuzzy Numbers (FNs). Each of these techniques has been shown to produce non-intuitive results in certain cases. In this paper, a new algorithm has been introduced for ranking FNs which considers both left and right (LR) sides. Through using several distinct points, this algorithm, provides the result with higher degree of certainty with respect methods which using one point. This algorithm, as shown by several examples, can be easily used for comparing triangular and trapezoidal FNs.", "paper_title": "A novel FNR algorithm considering L-R sides", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600013"}
