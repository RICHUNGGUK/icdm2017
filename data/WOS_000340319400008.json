If the channel crosstalk coefficients matrix is positive semidefinite, it is shown that the proposed neural network is stable in the sense of Lyapunov and global convergence to a Nash equilibrium, and the Nash equilibrium is unique if the channel crosstalk coefficients matrix is positive definite. Finally, simulation results on two numerical examples show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed neural network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
