The problem is solved by introducing dither type random movements to the agents' action which reduce the degradation caused by quantized measurements. A broadcast controller is derived and it is proven that the controller approximately achieves given tasks with probability I. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "Broadcast Control of Multi-Agent Systems with Quantized Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300015"}
