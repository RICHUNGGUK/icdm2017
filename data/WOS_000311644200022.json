The scheme couples conventional hydrodynamic conservation equations for mass and momentum-flux with molecular dynamics (MD) in a unified framework. The method is very much different from common 'domain-decomposition' hybrid methods, and is more related to micro-resolution methods, such as the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method. We optimise the use of the computationally-costly MD solvers by applying them only at a limited number of streamwise-distributed cross-sections of the macroscale geometry. The greater the streamwise scale of the geometry, the more significant is the computational speed-up when compared to a full MD simulation. We test our new multiscale method on the case of a converging/diverging nanochannel conveying a simple Lennard-Jones liquid. We validate the results from our simulations by comparing them to a full MD simulation of the same test case. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
