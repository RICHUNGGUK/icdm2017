The ASCDT+ algorithm can take both obstacles and facilitators into account without additional preprocessing, and automatically detects spatial clusters adjacent to each other with arbitrary shapes and/or different densities. In addition, the ASCDT+ algorithm has the ability to find clustering patterns at both global and local levels so that users can make a more complete interpretation of the clustering results. Several simulated and real-world datasets are utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the ASCDT+ algorithm. Comparison with two related algorithms, AUTOCLUST+ and DBRS+, demonstrates the advantages of the ASCDT+ algorithm. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
