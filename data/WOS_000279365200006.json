The purpose of this study is to propose a multi-attribute e-business website quality evaluation methodology based on a modified fuzzy TOPSIS approach. In the proposed methodology, weights of the evaluation criteria are generated by a fuzzy AHP procedure. In performance evaluation problems, the judgments of the experts may usually be vague in form. As fuzzy logic can successfully deal with this kind of uncertainty in human preferences, both classical TOPSIS and classical AHP procedures are implemented under fuzzy environment. The proposed TOPSIS-AHP methodology has successfully been applied to a multi-attribute website quality evaluation problem in Turkish e-business market. Nine sub-criteria under four main categories are used in the evaluation of the most popular e-business websites of Turkey. A sensitivity analysis is also provided.", "paper_title": "Multi-attribute Evaluation of Website Quality in E-business Using an Integrated Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS Methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000279365200006"}
