The downlink transmission is based on the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, whereas the uplink transmission uses a single-carrier frequency-division multiple access. The downlink implementations are based on the programmable transport triggered architecture (TTA) which provides a flexible and energy efficient architecture template. In TTA detector implementation, the LTE detection rate requirements up to 20 MHz bandwidth and 4 x 4 antenna system with 64-QAM, are achieved by using 1-6 programmable cores in parallel. Each core runs at 277 MHz clock frequency and consumes 55.5-64.0 mW depending on the detector configuration. The downlink detector is based on the selective spanning with fast enumeration algorithm. The uplink field-programmable gate array (FPGA) detector implementation is targeted for 4 x 4 antenna system and 64-QAM achieving a detection rate requirement for 20 MHz bandwidth. The used FPGA board for uplink implementation is Xilinx Virtex-6 and the implementation has been carried out using Xilinx Vivado high level synthesis tool. Two different detector architectures are implemented. The first one achieves the detection rate requirement with a single processing block running at 231 MHz and the latter one with four blocks in parallel, each running at 247 MHz. The implemented detector is based on the K-best algorithm. A multiple-input multiple-output receiver requires QRD to produce valid inputs for the detector. In addition to detector implementations, QRD is also implemented on both TTA and FPGA. Modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm is used in both QRD implementations.", "paper_title": "Novel detector implementations for 3G LTE downlink and uplink", "paper_id": "WOS:000331201500010"}
