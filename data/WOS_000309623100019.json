In this paper, first a mixed integer goal programming model is developed. Then, due to the complexity of the problem, which is NP-hard, we design a hybrid meta-heuristic applying simulated annealing framework. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain the optimal solution for instances up to 100 aircrafts, and also it is capable of finding very high quality and comparable solutions for the problems with up to 500 aircrafts and 5 runways in a short time.
