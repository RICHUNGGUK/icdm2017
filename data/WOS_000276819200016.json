These performances can be achieved by transforming a cover image from the spatial domain into the frequency domain through Haar digital wavelet transform (HDWT) method followed by an adaptive arithmetic coding method to encode the HDWT coefficients in a high-frequency band. The HPFRIH method was used to conceal both the compressed data and the secret data in the high-frequency band. This simple method can completely reconstruct the cover image only from the stego-image. Moreover, experimental results showed that the HPFRIH method offers both impressive hiding capacity and satisfied stego-image quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
