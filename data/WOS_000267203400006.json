However, this assumption is not necessarily appropriate. This paper is devoted to the tests for variance heterogeneity in these models. We initially discuss the simultaneous test for variance heterogeneity of two phases. When the simultaneous test shows that significant heteroscedasticity occurs in the whole model, we construct two individual tests to investigate whether or not both phases or one of them have/has significant heteroscedasticity. Several score statistics and their adjustments based on Cox and Reid [D. R. Cox and N. Reid, Parameter orthogonality and approximate conditional inference. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 49 (1987), pp. 1-39.] are obtained and illustrated with Australian onion data. The simulated powers of test statistics are investigated through Monte Carlo methods.", "paper_title": "Heteroscedasticity diagnostics in two-phase linear regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000267203400006"}
