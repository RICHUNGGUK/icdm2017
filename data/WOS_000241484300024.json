Reversible computation is characterized by means of invertible properties [1]. Quantum systems evolution is described by the time evolution operator U, which is unitary and invertible; therefore such systems can implement reversibility. Reversible/invertible Cellular Automata (CA) [1] are one of the most relevant reversible computational models. Here we introduce a model for a Josephson junction ladder (JJL) device addressing reversibility: it is based on a hybrid Cellular Automata Network (CAN), the CAN2 one [2][3][4].", "paper_title": "Introducing reversibility in a high level JJL qubit model according to CAN2 paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300024"}
