We discuss some fundamental problems with the previous algorithms and describe a new approach, based on merging grid cubes near sharp edges, that produces significantly better results. Our algorithm requires only gradients at the grid vertices, not at each surface-edge intersection point. We also give a method for measuring the correctness of the resulting sharp edges and corners in the isosurface.
