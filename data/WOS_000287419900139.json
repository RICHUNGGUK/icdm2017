The PESP schedules a number of recurring events, such that each pair of events fulfills certain constraints during a given time period. To solve such a hard PJSS problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm, namely EM-SA. which is based on electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) and simulated annealing (SA). To evaluate this proposed EMSA, some randomly constructed instances are solved, and the related results are compared with SA and optimum solutions obtained by the branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid EM-SA algorithm to solve the PJSSP. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
