Design/methodology/approach - The CMT is extensively used to analyze the wireless energy transfer system because of its generality, simplicity, accuracy and intuitive understanding of near-field resonant energy coupling mechanism. Findings - The CMT forms a general way to model and analyze the non-radiative magnetic resonant coupling systems. It is suitable not only for low frequency coupling but also for high frequency (of million-Hertz) in which the circuit parameters are not easily obtained. Optimal coupling condition corresponding to the maximum power transfer is identified based on the CMT, and the multiple limit cycle phenomenon caused by the nonlinear nature of the HPLED is also described on the CMT model. Originality/value - This paper takes advantages of CMT, i.e. generality, simplicity, accuracy and intuitive understanding to analyze the near-field resonant energy coupling system. Key characteristics of the systems are explored based on the CMT, not the usual equivalent circuit method. The influence of nonlinear nature of the high power LED on energy transfer is also investigated. This work seeks a more general way than conventional equivalent circuit method to model and analyze the resonant magnetic system and the results obtained could facilitate better understanding of the resonant magnetic coupling mechanism and optimal design of the near-field energy transfer system.", "paper_title": "Analysis of near-field magnetic resonant energy coupling for high power light-emitting diode illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000308896700019"}
