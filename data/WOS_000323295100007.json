The proposed method is based on a modified version of Dijkstra algorithm that works on an expanded so-called dual-network topology with nxn- nodes and 2xmxn links, where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of links in the original network. Despite the larger network size, the execution time of the algorithm is in polynomial order (mn+n(2) log n). Considering that the problem is NP-complete, the presented algorithm takes much less time than using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), which takes exponential time. Yet, it is able to find all available disjoint paths obtainable by ILP.", "paper_title": "Shortest Node-Disjoint Path using Dual-Network Topology in Optical Switched Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323295100007"}
