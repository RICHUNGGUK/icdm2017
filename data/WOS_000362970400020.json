Fuzzy equations can be used to model these nonlinear systems. The solutions of the fuzzy equations are the controllers. In this paper, we give the controllability condition for the fuzzy control via dual fuzzy equations. Two types of neural networks are applied to approximate the solutions of the fuzzy equations. These solutions are then transformed into the fuzzy controllers. The novel methods are validated with five benchmark examples.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy control for uncertainty nonlinear systems with dual fuzzy equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000362970400020"}
