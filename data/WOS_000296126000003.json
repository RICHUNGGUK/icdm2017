Based on the availability of several optical images of a same scene at various resolutions (medium, high, and very high spatial resolution), a hierarchical approach is proposed to progressively extract segments of interest from the lowest to the highest resolution data, and then finally determine urban patterns from VHSR images. This approach, inspired by the principle of photo-interpretation, has for purpose to use as much as possible the user's skills while minimising his/her interaction. In order to do so, at each resolution, an interactive segmentation of one sample region is required for each semantic class of the image. Then, the user's behaviour is automatically reproduced in the remainder of the image. This process is mainly based on tree-cuts in binary partition trees. Since it strongly relies on user-defined segmentation examples, it can involve only low level spatial and radiometric criteria, then enabling fast computation of comprehensive results. Experiments performed on urban images datasets provide satisfactory results which may be further used for classification purpose. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
