However, this optimism has been largely fueled by rather simple early studies, which do not consider all the system aspects in sufficient detail; the few early experimental works reported are proprietary and consider only a small number of nodes, whereas the existing more sophisticated theoretical studies focus on singular aspects of secondary spectrum access in isolation from the overall system interactions. In this paper we study quantitatively the deployment of secondary networks in TVWS by considering two archetypal candidate systems: LTE-like cellular and Wi-Fi-like networks. We develop a systematic framework for the performance evaluation of secondary networks, which we then use to obtain realistic estimates of the performance of our example systems. The secondary network performance assessment methodology demonstrated in this paper can be directly applied for other regions and systems. Our work explicitly takes into account limitations arising from aggregate interference, user density, and specific secondary transceiver characteristics. We argue that a systematic analysis, jointly considering all of these aspects, is key for obtaining realistic and robust results on the estimated value of whitespace spectrum. Our detailed system-level approach reveals a much more conservative picture of the realistic benefit of TVWS deployments than what has been commonly assumed thus far. We find that cellular TVWS networks have limited capabilities, but that a macro-cellular-only network may be a viable option for traffic offloading. Our results also show that Wi-Fi-like secondary deployments in TVWS, although increasing coverage range, lead to increased congestion, which limits the system capacity.", "paper_title": "Feasibility of Secondary Networks: Analysis Methodology and Quantitative Study of Cellular and Wi-Fi-Like TVWS Deployments", "paper_id": "WOS:000347098100011"}
