The problem is well known to be NP-hard, already for L = 4. We consider a generalization of RA, where each list is associated with a set of orderings, and our goal is to choose one ordering per list and to find a permutation of the elements that minimizes the total disagreements with the chosen orderings. For the case in which the lists completely overlap, i.e. each list contains all n elements, we show that a simple Greedy algorithm yields a (2 - 2/L)-approximation for generalized RA. The case in which the lists only partially overlap, i.e. each list contains a subset of the n elements, is much harder to approximate. In fact, we show that RA with multiple orderings per list and partial overlaps cannot be approximated within any bounded ratio. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
