Indeed, a large number of mobile terminals, supporting multiple networking technologies, may be used to manage data from everywhere and at anytime. However, the effort required for achieving security, given the complexity of cryptographic algorithms, heavily affects the power consumption of terminals. Such energy demand, together with the one required to manage communication activities, makes energy-efficient secure communication among hardware-constrained handheld devices a challenging topic. In this work, we introduce an analytic energy model for secure communication among multi-mode terminals. This model describes the energy consumption of mobile terminals operating within a dynamic network scenario, considering both their interconnection and secure data exchange issues, in order to develop adaptive strategies for energy-efficient secure communications. Finally, the model has been validated through simulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
