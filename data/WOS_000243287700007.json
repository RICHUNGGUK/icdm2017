Similarity measures, originally introduced to express the degree of comparison between two fuzzy sets, can be applied to digital images. We will show how neighbourhood-based similarity measures and histogram similarity measures can be combined in order to improve the perceptive behaviour of these similarity measures. In this way, we obtained several new image quality measures, which outperform the Mean Squared Error in the sense of image quality evaluation because the results of the new measures coincide better with human perception.
