The collection.A4( J) of the homogeneous polynomial ideals I, such that the monomials outside J form a K-vector basis of S/I. is called a J-marked family. It can be endowed with a structure of affine scheme, called a J-marked scheme. For special ideals J, J-marked schemes provide an open cover of the Hilbert scheme Hilb(p(t))(n), where p(t) is the Hilbert polynomial of S/J. Those ideals more suitable to this aim are the m-truncation ideals (J) under bar >=(m) generated by the monomials of degree >= m in a saturated strongly stable monomial ideal (J) under bar. Exploiting a characterization of the ideals in Mf((J) under bar >=(m)) in terms of a Buchberger-like criterion, we compute the equations defining the J >=(m)-marked scheme by a new reduction relation, called superminimal reduction, and obtain an embedding of Mf((J) under bar >=(m)) in an affine space of low dimension. In this setting, explicit computations are achievable in many non-trivial cases. Moreover, for every m, we give a closed embedding phi(m) : Mf((J) under bar >=(m)) hooked right arrow Mf((J) under bar >=(m+1)), characterize those phi(m) that are isomorphisms in terms of the monomial basis of (J) under bar. especially we characterize the minimum integer m(0) such that phi(m) is an isomorphism for every in >= m(0).
