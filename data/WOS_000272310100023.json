In addition, the relationships between pre-service teachers' visual intelligence and their perception and analysis (interpretation) of visual materials were also explored. Participants were 86 pre-service teachers who took a one-credit required educational technology course at a mid-western university in the United States. Some participants were absent in the weeks when data were collected, resulting in a total of 59 responses included in data analysis. Findings implied that the instruction of visual design principles could possibly improve pre-service teachers' visual literacy. Suggestions for future research were discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
