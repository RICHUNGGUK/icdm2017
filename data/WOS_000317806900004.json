There is variety of classifier combination techniques and the major difficulty is to choose one that is the best fit for a particular task. In our study we explored the performance of a number of combination methods such as voting, Bayesian merging, behavior knowledge space, bagging, stacking, feature sub-spacing and cascading, for the part-of-speech tagging task using nine corpora in five languages. The results show that some methods that, currently, are not very popular could demonstrate much better performance. In addition, we learned how the corpus size and quality influence the combination methods performance. We also provide the results of applying the classifier combination methods to the other NLP tasks, such as name entity recognition and chunking. We believe that our study is the most exhaustive comparison made with combination methods applied to NIP tasks so far. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
