This mode exploits inter-channel correlation using reconstructed luma to predict chroma linearly with parameters derived from neighboring reconstructed luma and chroma pixels at both encoder and decoder to avoid overhead signaling. In this paper, we analyze the LM mode and prove that the LM parameters for predicting original chroma and reconstructed chroma are statistically the same. We also analyze the error sensitivity of the LM parameters. We identify some LM mode problematic situations and propose three novel LM-like modes called LMA, LML, and LMO to address the situations. To limit the increase in complexity due to the LM-like modes, we propose some fast algorithms with the help of some new cost functions. We further identify some potentially-problematic conditions in the parameter estimation (including regression dilution problem) and introduce a novel model correction technique to detect and correct those conditions. Simulation results suggest that considerable BD-rate reduction can be achieved by the proposed LM-like modes and model correction technique. In addition, the performance gain of the two techniques appears to be essentially additive when combined.", "paper_title": "Chroma Intra Prediction Based on Inter-Channel Correlation for HEVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000329195500022"}
