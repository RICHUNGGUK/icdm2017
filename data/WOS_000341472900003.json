The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, the broadband performance of a great number of underground LV/BPL and MV/BPL connections with (N + 1)-hop repeater system has been studied with regard to capacity and the proposed metric of capacity outage probability (COP). The analysis and relevant simulations validate the significant capacity improvement in comparison with existing underground LV/BPL and MV/BPL systems when multiple repeaters are installed across them. Second, it is found that the underground BPL network capacity performance depends drastically on factors such as the electromagnetic interference (EMI) limits and the deployment of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems across the underground BPL connections. Adopting (N + 1)-hop repeater systems, capacity losses due to: (i) existing strict EMI limits; and (ii) avoidance of MIMO/LV/BPL and MIMO/MV/BPL systems deployment; can be reduced. Third, the numerical simulations reveal the importance of considering as a suitable countermeasure technique against potential capacity discrepancies the installation of (N + 1)-hop repeater system across the existing underground BPL connections. This capacity mitigation technique can significantly improve the capacity performance of existing LV/BPL and MV/BPL installations when strict EMI limits or disregard of MIMO system installations inhibit imminent BPL network expansion.
