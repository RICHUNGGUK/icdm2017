To reduce the computational time for high-dimensional problems, this paper presents a parallel differential evolution (DE) based on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The proposed approach is called GOjDE, which employs self-adapting control parameters and generalized opposition-based learning (GOBL). The adapting parameters strategy is helpful to avoid manually adjusting the control parameters, and GOBL is beneficial for improving the quality of candidate solutions. Simulation experiments are conducted on a set of recently proposed high-dimensional benchmark problems with dimensions of 100, 200, 500 and 1,000. Simulation results demonstrate that GjODE is better than, or at least comparable to, six other algorithms, and employing CPU can effectively reduce computational time. The obtained maximum speedup is up to 75. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
