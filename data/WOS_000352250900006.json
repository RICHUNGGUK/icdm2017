The algorithm is based on multivariate generalized linear mixed models and it builds piecewise constant coefficient functions. Moreover, it is scalable for many moderators of possibly mixed scales, integrates interactions between moderators and can handle nonlinearities. Although the scope of the algorithm is quite general, the focus is on its usage in an ordinal longitudinal regression setting. The potential of the algorithm is illustrated by using data derived from the British Household Panel Study, to show how the effect of unemployment on self-reported happiness varies across individual life circumstances.(1) (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
