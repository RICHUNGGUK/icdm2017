In such scenarios, an appropriate model at a time point may rapidly become obsolete, requiring updating or replacement. As there are several learning algorithms available, choosing one whose bias suits the current data best is not a trivial task. In this paper, we present a meta-learning based method for periodic algorithm selection in time-changing environments, named MetaStream. It works by mapping the characteristics extracted from the past and incoming data to the performance of regression models in order to choose between single learning algorithms or their combination. Experimental results for two real regression problems showed that MetaStream is able to improve the general performance of the learning system compared to a baseline method and an ensemble-based approach.
