Decomposition methods have been studied extensively, but many methods return real-valued matrices. Interpreting real-valued factor matrices is hard if the original data is Boolean. In this paper, we describe a matrix decomposition formulation for Boolean data, the Discrete Basis Problem. The problem seeks for a Boolean decomposition of a binary matrix, thus allowing the user to easily interpret the basis vectors. We also describe a variation of the problem, the Discrete Basis Partitioning Problem. We show that both problems are NP-hard. For the Discrete Basis Problem, we give a simple greedy algorithm for solving it; for the Discrete Basis Partitioning Problem, we show how it can be solved using existing methods. We present experimental results for the greedy algorithm and compare it against other well-known methods. Our algorithm gives intuitive basis vectors, but its reconstruction error is usually larger than with the real-valued methods. We discuss the reasons for this behavior.", "paper_title": "The discrete basis problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000259192400005"}
