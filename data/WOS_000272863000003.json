Therefore most notations are not understood by the business users due to the complexity of them. In this paper we present a notation that allows business users to model their business process. For this reason the notation must be agile, easy to learn and design, and capable to provide semantic information about the process. With the objective of demonstrating the characteristics of the proposal notation in this paper we make a research to compare and evaluate the usability of the notation with the standard notation more extended, BPMN.
