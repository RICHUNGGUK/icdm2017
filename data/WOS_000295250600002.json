Based on the elastic-plastic analysis of a single pile in a layered soil, the shielding effect between a receiver pile and the soil is taken into account to modify the conventional interaction factor between two piles. An approximate approach with the concept of the interaction factor is employed to study the nonlinear behavior of pile groups with a rigid cap. Considering the variation of soil properties, the solution to multilayered elastic materials is used to calculate the settlement of the soil. The interactions between pile-soil-raft are taken into account to determine the stiffness matrix of the piled raft. By solving the stiffness matrix equations, the settlement and the load shared by the piles and raft could be obtained. Compared with results of the available published literatures, the proposed solution provides reasonable results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
