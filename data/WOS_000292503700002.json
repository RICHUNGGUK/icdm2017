In complex systems with real-time operating systems (RTOS), the timing properties of the system are decided by both the applications and RTOS. Traditionally, WCET analysis mainly deals with application programs, while it is crucial to know whether RTOS also behaves in a timely predictable manner. In this paper, static analysis techniques are used to predict the WCET of the system calls and the Disable Interrupt regions of the mu C/OS-II real-time kernel, which presents a quantitative evaluation of the real-time performance of mu C/OS-II. The precision of applying existing WCET analysis techniques on RTOS is evaluated, and the practical difficulties in using static methods in timing analysis of RTOS are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Static worst-case execution time analysis of the mu C/OS-II real-time kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000292503700002"}
