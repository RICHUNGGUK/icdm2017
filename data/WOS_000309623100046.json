The parallel system is modeled as an MAP/M/2 queue with two types of jobs. While one type of jobs requires only one server, the other type needs both the servers before leaving the system. Using matrix-analytic methods, we analyze the queueing system in steady state. We report some interesting performance measures as well as illustrative examples to bring out the qualitative nature of the model under study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
