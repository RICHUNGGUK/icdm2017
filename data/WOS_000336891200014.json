The framework applies spatio-temporal geometric flows extracted by bandlets to reconstruct the missing data. First, a priority-based exemplar scheme enhanced by a bandlet-based patch fusion generates a preliminary inpainting result. Then, the inpainting task is completed by a 3D volume regularization algorithm which takes advantage of bandlet bases in exploiting the anisotropic regularities. The method does not need extra processes in order to satisfy visual consistency. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed video completion technique.
