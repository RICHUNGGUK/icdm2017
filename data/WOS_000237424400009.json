It has been widely used in computer vision, pattern recognition, morphological filtering, and robotics. This paper proposes a systolic algorithm that computes the Euclidean distance map of an N x N binary image in 3N clocks on 2N(2) processing cells. The algorithm is designed so that the hardware resources are reduced; especially no mulitipliers are used and, thus, it facilitates VLSI implementation.", "paper_title": "A systolic algorithm for Euclidean distance transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000237424400009"}
