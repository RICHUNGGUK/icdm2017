SmartCrowd distinguishes itself by formulating, for the first time, the problem of worker-to-task assignment in KI-C as an optimization problem, by proposing efficient adaptive algorithms to solve it and by accounting for human factors, such as worker expertise, wage requirements, and availability inside the optimization process. We present rigorous theoretical analyses of the task assignment optimization problem and propose optimal and approximation algorithms with guarantees, which rely on index pre-computation and adaptive maintenance. We perform extensive performance and quality experiments using real and synthetic data to demonstrate that the SmartCrowd approach is necessary to achieve efficient task assignments of high-quality under guaranteed cost budget.", "paper_title": "Task assignment optimization in knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358255800001"}
