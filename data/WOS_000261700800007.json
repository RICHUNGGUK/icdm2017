We prove a conjecture from (Stojakovic and Szabo, Random Struct and Algorithms 26 (2005), 204-223.). asserting, that the property that Maker is able to win this game, has a sharp threshold at logn/n. Our theorem can be considered a game-theoretic strengthening of classical results from the theory of random graphs: not only (foes G(n, p) almost surely admit a Hamilton cycle for p = (1 + epsilon)logn/n but Maker is able to build One while playing against an adversary.
