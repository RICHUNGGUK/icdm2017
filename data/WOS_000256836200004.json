Our theoretical and numerical studies of the radiation and resonance behaviors of the proposed metamaterial-based EESA systems, as well as our efforts to conceptualize structures which might be used to build them, have led to the discovery of several realizable metamaterial-inspired EESA systems. The measurement results confirm the numerical performance predictions.", "paper_title": "A summary of recent developments on metamaterial-based and metamaterial-inspired efficient electrically small antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000256836200004"}
