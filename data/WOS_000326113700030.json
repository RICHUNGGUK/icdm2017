The presented scheme not only maintains the main advantages of the ISMC design, including robustness, rapid response and easy implementation, but it can also tolerate some actuator faults when fault detection and diagnosis information is available. In this study, the uncertainties and/or disturbances are not required to be of the matched type; however, when they are matched, the state trajectories of the nominal healthy subsystem and the uncertain faulty system are identical. As a result, engineers can predictively address the matched uncertain faulty system performance in light of the performance of the nominal healthy subsystem. The analytic results are also applied to the study of a vehicle brake reliable control system. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Reliable Control With Application to a Vehicle Antilock Brake System", "paper_id": "WOS:000326113700030"}
