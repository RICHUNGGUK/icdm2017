Conic polygons are polygons consisting of conic segments or bounded conics with directions. Preliminaries of Boolean operations on general polygons are presented. In our algorithm, the intersection points and the topological relationships between two conic polygons are computed. Boundaries are obtained by tracking path and selecting uncrossed boundaries following rule tables to build resulting conic polygons. We define a set of rules for the intersection, union, and subtraction operations on conic polygons. The algorithm considers degeneration cases such as homology, complement, interior, and exterior. The algorithm is also evaluated and implemented.", "paper_title": "Boolean Operations on Conic Polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000266386500014"}
