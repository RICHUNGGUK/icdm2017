The basis for the engine is a semantic indexing process which derives a lexicon of 101 concepts. To support the user in navigating the collection, the system defines a visual similarity space, a semantic similarity space, a semantic thread space, and browsers to explore them. It extends upon [1] with improved browsing tools. The search system is evaluated within the TRECVID benchmark [2]. We obtain a tops result for 19 out of 24 search topics. In addition, we obtain the highest mean average precision of all search participants.", "paper_title": "Mediamill: Advanced browsing in news video archives", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500062"}
