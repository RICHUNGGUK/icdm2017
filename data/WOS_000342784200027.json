As an under-resourced language. Malay lacks the necessary resources for the development of such a system, especially segment-phonetic labels. This research aims at developing an HMM-based speech synthesis system for Malay. We are proposing the use of two types of training HMMs, which are the benchmark iterative training incorporating the DAEM algorithm and isolated unit training applying segment-phonetic labels of Malay. The preferred method for preparing segment-phonetic labels is the automatic segmentation. The automatic segmentation of Malay speech database is performed using two approaches which are uniform segmentation that applies fixed phone duration, and a cross-lingual approach that adopts the acoustic model of English. We have measured the segmentation error of the two segmentation approaches to ascertain their relative effectiveness. A listening test was used to evaluate the intelligibility and naturalness of the synthetic speech produced from the iterative and isolated unit training. We also compare the performance of the HMM-based speech synthesis system with existing Malay speech synthesis systems.", "paper_title": "Developing an HMM-Based Speech Synthesis System for Malay: A Comparison of Iterative and Isolated Unit Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200027"}
