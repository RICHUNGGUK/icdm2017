Project management refers to disciplines that enhance management of inherent strengths and weaknesses of a project. In contrast to external factors, project management frequently ignores internal factors. Such factors, involving internal services within the team, focus on working with people, ensuring customer satisfaction, and creating a conducive environment for the project team to deliver high quality products, which meet stakeholder expectations. This research investigated the intertwined effects of project team internal factors, and proposes a hybrid method that combines exploratory factor analysis and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique to solve an empirical case. Exploratory factor analysis was applied for extracting the dimension and criteria structure of internal factors. The DEMATEL technique was then used to analyze the intertwined effect. This research found, in the dimensional level, attitude highly influences other internal factors towards project success, while work loading is a key factor in criteria level that greatly influences all others. The proposed method has proven to be effective for analyzing the complex interrelation of human psychological concerns.", "paper_title": "EVALUATING INTERTWINED EFFECTS OF TEAM INTERNAL FACTORS ON PROJECT SUCCESS: A HYBRID METHOD COMBINING EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS AND THE DEMATEL TECHNIQUE", "paper_id": "WOS:000310118400032"}
