In this paper, a brief view of the equilibrium point hypothesis for human motor system modeling is given, and the A-model derived from this hypothesis is studied. The stability of the A-model based on equilibrium and Jacobian matrix is investigated. The results obtained in this paper suggest that the A-model is stable and has a unique equilibrium point under certain conditions.", "paper_title": "Biomechanical stability analysis of the lambda-model controlling one joint", "paper_id": "WOS:000248242000006"}
