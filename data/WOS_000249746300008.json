Automated speech recognition decodes speech samples into plaintext (other representations are possible) and must process samples at real-time rates. Fortunately, the computational tasks involved in this pipeline are highly data parallel and can receive significant hardware acceleration from vector-streaming architectures such as the Cell/B.E. Architecture. Identifying and exploiting these parallelism opportunities is challenging and critical to improving system performance. From our initial performance timings, we observed that a single Cell/B.E. processor can recognize speech from thousands of simultaneous voice channels in real time-a channel density that is orders of magnitude greater than the capacity of existing software speech recognizers based on CPUs (central processing units). This result emphasizes the potential for Cell/B.E. processor based speech recognition and will likely lead to the development of production speech systems using Cell/B.E. processor clusters.", "paper_title": "Speech recognition systems on the cell broadband engine processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000249746300008"}
