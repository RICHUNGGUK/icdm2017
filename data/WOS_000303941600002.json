The magnetic interactions are realized through a Yukawa-like potential while particles interact through Lenard-Jones forces. Our preliminary results point to a very rich phase transition picture. At high density the system seems to undergoes a transition, as suggested by the magnetization and susceptibility results.", "paper_title": "MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATION OF A TWO-DIMENSIONAL HEISENBERG FLUID", "paper_id": "WOS:000303941600002"}
