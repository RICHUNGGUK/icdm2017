For functions on the Boolean hypercube {0, 1}(n), we show a lower bound of Omega(2(n/4)/n) on the number of queries needed by a quantum computer to solve this problem. More surprisingly, our approach, based on Ambainis's quantum adversary method, also yields a lower bound of Omega (2(n/2)/n(2)) on the problem's classical randomized query complexity. This improves and simplifies a 1983 result of Aldous. Finally, in both the randomized and quantum cases, we give the first nontrivial lower bounds for finding local minima on grids of constant dimension d >= 3.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds for local search by quantum arguments", "paper_id": "WOS:000236097900003"}
