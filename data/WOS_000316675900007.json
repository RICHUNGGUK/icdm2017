Previous studies have focused on the yield improvement for an individual rice mill. There is a need to develop a framework to address the multitude of variables influencing the design of a rice mill complex, which include fluctuating thermal and electrical energy demands, diverse energy supply options, fluctuating product demands, resource availability and product degradation. The objective of this study is to develop a framework for the optimal design and planning of the product portfolio and processing route of an integrated, resource-efficient (IRE) rice mill complex. The objective function is to maximise the profitability of the rice mill by using the developed multi-period mathematical model. Sensitivity analysis was performed on the case study to evaluate the impact of fluctuating product demands, product prices and electricity cost on the production throughput, process configuration and profitability of the IRE rice mill complex.
