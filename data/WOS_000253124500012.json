NNDSVD can readily be combined with existing NMF algorithms. The basic algorithm contains no randomization and is based on two SVD processes, one approximating the data matrix, the other approximating positive sections of the resulting partial SVD factors utilizing an algebraic property of unit rank matrices. Simple practical variants for NMF with dense factors are described. NNDSVD is also well suited to initialize NMF algorithms with sparse factors. Many numerical examples suggest that NNDSVD leads to rapid reduction of the approximation error of many NMF algorithms. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
