Error-free 40 Gbits/s wavelength conversion for three different probe wavelengths is demonstrated. The impact of the output filter bandwidth and filter detuning on the performance of wavelength conversion is studied in detail. The optical label modulation of the on-chip DI-MZI is first demonstrated with amplitude- and phase-shift key schemes.
