In the clustering mechanism, the current cluster head nodes determine cluster head nodes for next round according to the residual energy of the cluster members. In the next round, each non-cluster head node decides the cluster to which it will belong according to energy-distance function. The cluster head nodes send data to base station by the communication model of single hop and multihop that is decided according to the criterion of minimum energy consumption. In EBSC algorithm, the number of cluster head nodes generated in each round is very steady, and EBSC combines the advantage both distributed and centralized clustering algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed routing algorithm not only efficiently uses limited energy of network nodes, but also well balances energy consumption of all nodes, and significantly prolongs network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Wireless Meter Reading Based Energy-Balanced Steady Clustering Routing Algorithm for Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000293840500002"}
