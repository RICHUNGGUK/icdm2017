Because of its cost, the latter process can be approached by using metaheuristic techniques such as genetic algorithms. However, existing works show that, if dealing with Mamdani rules - where the consequent is a linguistic label -, a basic local search clearly outperforms the genetic algorithm. In this work we aim to develop a local search algorithm to carry out the described process for the case of TSK-0 fuzzy rules, where the consequent is a real number. The experimental results show that some of the proposed algorithms clearly improve upon the state-of-the-art ones in terms of precision and number of rules, whereas learning times are fairly competitive and are orders of magnitude lower than those required by the genetic algorithm.
