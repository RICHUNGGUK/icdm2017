As the first goal, distributed behavioral imitation, which is necessary to fit agents with complicated motion equations in kinematic frames, is discussed. Providing real agents with behavioral controller makes them capable to act as a kinematic particle. The second goal is to design an active leading strategy for the LA to move the group on a predefined path. Both problems can be mathematically modeled in an affine form, which is the reason behind using a unique adaptive controller to solve them. The controller is based on a neuro-fuzzy structure with critic-based leaning structure. It is shown that the proposed controller can successfully handle both tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
