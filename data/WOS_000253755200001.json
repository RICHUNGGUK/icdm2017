Many of the papers describing new techniques and descriptors for content-based image retrieval describe their newly proposed methods as most appropriate without giving an in-depth comparison with all methods that were proposed earlier. In this paper, we first give an overview of a large variety of features for content-based image retrieval and compare them quantitatively on four different tasks: stock photo retrieval, personal photo collection retrieval, building retrieval, and medical image retrieval. For the experiments, five different, publicly available image databases are used and the retrieval performance of the features is analyzed in detail. This allows for a direct comparison of all features considered in this work and furthermore will allow a comparison of newly proposed features to these in the future. Additionally, the correlation of the features is analyzed, which opens the way for a simple and intuitive method to find an initial set of suitable features for a new task. The article concludes with recommendations which features perform well for what type of data. Interestingly, the often used, but very simple, color histogram performs well in the comparison and thus can be recommended as a simple baseline for many applications.", "paper_title": "Features for image retrieval: an experimental comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000253755200001"}
