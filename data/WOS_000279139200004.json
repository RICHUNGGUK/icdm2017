We devise a numerical method to obtain solutions on only parts of the boundary with little computational effort. The method incorporates asymptotic properties of the solution and can therefore attain particularly good results for high frequencies. We show that the integral equation in this approach reduces to an ordinary differential equation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
