While MS runs fast and can handle non-rigid objects represented by their color distribution, CT is more time-consuming but achieves a generic tracking by mixing color and texture information. Each method is modified in order to alleviate their intrinsic limitations, and make the tracking adaptive to a changing context. Concerning MS, the colorspace is changed automatically when necessary to enhance the distinction between the object and the background. Regarding CT, the number of features is reduced without loss of accuracy, by using Local Binary Patterns. Finally, their complementary advantages are exploited in a cooperation process, which runs faster than CT alone, and is more robust than MS alone. A comprehensive study is made for their acceleration and their efficient execution on different multi-core CPUs. A speedup of x2.8 is reached for MS and x2.6 for CT.", "paper_title": "Color tracking with contextual switching: real-time implementation on CPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000354715300015"}
