In this study, we seek to expand our understanding of media usage in organizations where there is a multiplicity of communication media available to employees. We use communication media repertoires as the lens through which we explore how media is used in the support of communication-based work performed by individuals in complex organizational settings. Data were collected in sales divisions at two large corporations in the information technology industry. We compared multiple media use within and between the two sales divisions, and identified similarities and differences in repertoires. Our findings suggest that use of repertoires is influenced by institutional conditions (e.g., incentives, trust, and physical proximity) and situational conditions (e.g., urgency, task, etc.), and by routine use of the media overtime. Based on the findings, we propose a frame work for investigating the use of multiple media in organizations through examination of communication media repertoires. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.", "paper_title": "Communication media repertoires: Dealing with the multiplicity of media choices", "paper_id": "WOS:000246728300004"}
