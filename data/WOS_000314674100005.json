In this paper, we address a different formulation of the inverse problem: from a single time point image of a non-swollen brain tumor, estimate the tumor source location and the diffusivity ratio between white and gray matter, while exploring the possibility to predict the further extent of the observed tumor at later time points in low-grade gliomas. The synthetic and clinical results show the stability of the located source and its varying distance from the tumor barycenter and how the estimated ratio controls the spikiness of the tumor.
