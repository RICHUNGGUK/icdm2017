Also it is well known that the reflexive and anti-reflexive matrices have wide applications in many fields. In this article, we consider the generalised coupled Sylvester matrix equations over reflexive and anti-reflexive matrices. First we propose two new matrix equations equivalent to the generalised coupled Sylvester matrix equations over reflexive and anti-reflexive matrices, respectively. Then two new iterative algorithms are proposed for solving these matrix equations. The convergence analysis of the proposed iterative algorithms is derived. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the theoretical results of this article.", "paper_title": "On the reflexive and anti-reflexive solutions of the generalised coupled Sylvester matrix equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000278010100001"}
