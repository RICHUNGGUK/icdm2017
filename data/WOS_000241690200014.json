Because of the problem of data sparseness, smoothing methods are employed to estimate the probability for each event (including all the seen and unseen events) in a language model. A set of properties used to analyze the statistical behaviors of three smoothing methods are proposed. Our proposed smoothing methods comply with all the properties. We implement three language models in Mandarin data sets and then discuss the entropy. In general, the entropies of proposed smoothing method for three models are lower than that of other two methods.", "paper_title": "Statistical Behavior analysis of smoothing methods for language models of mandarin data sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200014"}
