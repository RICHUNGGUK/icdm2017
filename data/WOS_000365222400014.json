In this paper, we present an approach to encode independent videos using H.264 intra encoder on a single hardware platform, where the hardware resources are shared by independent encoders in a time-multiplexed manner. In addition to lowering the latency introduced by multicasting, we address the strong sequential data dependencies within the encoder. At 25 frames/s, 150 MHz prototype of the proposed encoder and multiple video capture/display on a mid-range field programmable gate array is also presented.", "paper_title": "Multicast FullHD H.264 Intra Video Encoder Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000365222400014"}
