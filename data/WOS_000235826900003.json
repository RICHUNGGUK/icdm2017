As c,, is a uniformly recurrent infinite word, any (palindromic) factor of c, occurs infinitely many times in c(alpha), with bounded gaps. Our aim is to completely describe where palindromes occur in c(alpha), In particular, given any palindromic factor u of c(alpha), we shall establish a decomposition of c(alpha), with respect to the occurrences of u. Such a decomposition shows precisely where u occurs in c(alpha), and this is directly related to the continued fraction expansion of a. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
