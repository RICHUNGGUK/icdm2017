The subgrid scale dissipation is performed by the explicit high-order numerical filter used for numerical stability purpose. A shock-capturing non-linear filter is also used to deal with compressible discontinuous flows. In order to tackle complex geometries, an overset-grid approach is used. High-order interpolations make possible the communication between overlapping domains. The whole algorithm is first validated on canonical flow problems to illustrate both its properties for shock-capturing as well as for accurate wave propagation. Then, the influence of the multi-domain approach on the high-order spatial accuracy is assessed. Finally, a rod-airfoil configuration is studied to highlight the potential of the proposed algorithm to deal with multi-scale aeroacoustic applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
