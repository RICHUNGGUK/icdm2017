Currently, most existing works use the Equi-Frequency Sampling (EFS) methods or EFS based methods for data acquisition. However, the accuracy of EFS and EFS based methods cannot be guaranteed in practice since the physical world keeps changing continuously, and these methods do not effectively support reconstruction of the monitored physical world. To overcome the shortages of EFS and EFS based methods, this paper focuses on designing physical-world-aware data acquisition algorithms to support O(is an element of)-approximation to the physical world for any is an element of >= 0. Two physical-world-aware data acquisition algorithms are proposed. Both algorithms can adjust the sensing frequency automatically based on the changing trend of the physical world and the given is an element of. The thorough analysis on the performances of the algorithms are also provided. It is proven that the error bounds of the algorithms are O(is an element of) and the complexities of the algorithms are O(1/(is an element of)1/4). Based on the new data acquisition algorithms, an algorithm for reconstructing the physical world is proposed and analyzed. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed algorithms have high performances on the aspects of accuracy and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Approximate Physical World Reconstruction Algorithms in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347015800006"}
