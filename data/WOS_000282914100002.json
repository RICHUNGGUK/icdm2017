In some mobile applications, the data items broadcast are dependent upon one another. However, most prior studies on broadcasting dependent data do not employ replication in broadcast program generation. In view of this, we explore in this paper the problem of broadcasting dependent data in multiple broadcast channels, and explicitly investigate the effect of data replication. After analyzing the model of dependent data broadcasting, we derive several theoretical properties to formulate the average access time of broadcast programs. In light of the theoretical results, we develop an algorithm to exploit replication on broadcast program generation. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate broadcast programs of very high quality. In addition, the results also show that broadcast programs with replication is more robust than those without replication in error-prone environments.", "paper_title": "Exploiting replication on dependent data allocation for ordered queries over multiple broadcast channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000282914100002"}
