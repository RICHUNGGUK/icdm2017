Firstly, the fuzzy mapping aggregation operator based on RIMER are introduced and followed by the corresponding fuzzy inference method. Secondly, the collection of the sensitive words and their substitutions and the soft inference are discussed mainly based on our previous achievements. Then the new flowchart of the semantic analysis and the bases and the modules in the Chinese word proofing system are illustrated subsequently. The experiment shows that it is more feasible and practical method for semantic analysis.", "paper_title": "THE FUZZY MAPPING AGGREGATION OPERATOR BASED ON RIMER AND ITS APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000336214400005"}
