In this paper, we study the possible mechanisms that explain why subjects' decisions often obey this law. On the basis of reinforcement learning theory, we put forward a decision-making model in which the policy is updated by a policy parameter, and the model might be implemented in the brain through the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia neural circuit. Based on this model, an algorithm that satisfies the matching law is derived under some simple assumptions. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the decision behavior achieved by the algorithm obeys the matching law. In addition, the matching behaviors in two classical experiments are reproduced using the algorithm. Our results provide a reasonable strategy for the matching law and a useful computational tool for rewarded decision-making tasks.", "paper_title": "A stochastic policy search model for matching behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000292269700010"}
