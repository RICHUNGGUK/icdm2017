Memory banks are also important sources of leakage since the majority of transistors are utilized for on-chip caches in today's high performance microprocessors. A new nine-transistor (9T) SRAM cell is proposed in this paper for simultaneously reducing leakage power and enhancing data stability. The proposed 9T SRAM cell completely isolates the data from the bit lines during a read operation. The read static-noise-margin of the proposed circuit is thereby enhanced by 2 X as compared to a conventional six-transistor (6T) SRAM cell. The idle 9T SRAM cells are placed into a super cutoff sleep mode, thereby reducing the leakage power consumption by 22.9% as compared to the standard 6T SRAM cells in a 65-nm CMOS technology. The leakage power reduction and read stability enhancement provided with the new circuit technique are also verified under process parameter variations.", "paper_title": "Characterization of a novel nine-transistor SRAM cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000254782900015"}
