In this architecture, path computation does not occur at the head-end LSR, but on another path computation entity that may not be physically located on the headend LSR. This method is greatly different from the traditional \"per-domain\" approach to path computation. This article presents analysis and results that compare performance of the PCE architecture with the current state-of-the-art approach. Detailed simulations are undertaken on varied and realistic scenarios where preliminary results show several performance benefits from the deployment of PCE..To provide a complete overview of significant development taking place in this area, milestones and progress at the IETF PCE WG are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Path-computation-element-based architecture for interdomain in MPLS/GMPLS traffic engineering overview and performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235200006"}
