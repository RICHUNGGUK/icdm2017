We extend it to a modal logic of abstract argumentation to generalize Dung's theory and define variants of it. Moreover, we use the logic to relate Dung's theory of abstract argumentation to more traditional conditional and comparative formalisms, and we illustrate how to reason about arguments in meta-argumentation.", "paper_title": "A logic of abstract argumentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626900002"}
