New delay-dependent stability criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities for recurrent neural networks with time-varying delay are derived by the newly proposed augmented simple Lyapunov-Krasovski functional. Different from previous results by using the first-order convex combination property, our derivation applies the idea of second-order convex combination and the property of quadratic convex function which is given in the form of a lemma without resorting to Jensen's inequality. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the presented results.", "paper_title": "Stability Analysis for Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delay Based on Quadratic Convex Combination", "paper_id": "WOS:000315517400001"}
