Information is routed through the network using facilitating dynamic synapses with short-term plasticity. Learning occurs through long-term synaptic plasticity which is implemented using the temporal difference learning rule to enable the robot to learn to associate the correct movement with the appropriate input conditions. The network self-organizes to provide memories of environments that the robot encounters. A Pioneer robot simulator with laser and sonar proximity sensors is used to verify the performance of the network with a wall-following task, and the results are presented.", "paper_title": "Biologically Inspired SNN for Robot Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000317643500010"}
