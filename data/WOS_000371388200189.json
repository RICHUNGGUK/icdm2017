Besides the propagation environment that determines the channel bit error rate, packet payload size has a significant effect on the packet loss rate. In this paper, we first discuss the effect of packet size on the packet reception ratio, and then propose a broadcast protocol that is able to specify the best relay node by taking into account the data payload size. The proposed protocol employs a fuzzy logic-based algorithm to jointly consider multiple metrics (link quality, inter-vehicle distance, and vehicle mobility) and uses a redundancy transmission approach to ensure high reliability. Since the fuzzy membership functions are tuned by using reinforcement learning, the protocol can adapt to various network scenarios. We use both real-world experiments and computer simulations to evaluate the proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "Packet Size-Aware Broadcasting in VANETs With Fuzzy Logic and RL-Based Parameter Adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200189"}
