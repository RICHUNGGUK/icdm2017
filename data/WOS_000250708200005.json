Our solution approaches seek to maximize the profitability of the resulting schedule under job-specific tardiness costs and reducible processing times (at a cost). We present an algorithm that maximizes schedule profit for a given sequence of jobs, along with two heuristic approaches for generating good job sequences. A set of computational tests on randomly generated problem instances demonstrates the relative effectiveness of our proposed heuristic approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
