But energy efficiency sacrifices the communication delay between source and sink node. Therefore, many researchers have mentioned of energy and delay trade-offs. But the delay was not the main concern. In this paper we propose EAR-RT, an real-time guaranteed routing protocol for wireless sensor networks without harming energy awareness. Simulation results show that our real-time routing algorithm provides real-time guaranteed delivery while network is stable.", "paper_title": "EAR-RT: Energy aware routing with real-time guarantee for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500126"}
