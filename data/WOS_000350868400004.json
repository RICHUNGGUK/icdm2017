Therefore, the knowledge of applications' behavior and resources' usage pattern improves resource discovery decisions. This knowledge can be provided for the resource discovery mechanism by cooperating with the load balancing mechanism. In this paper, we formulate their cooperation by considering some parameters that represent applications' behavior and resources' usage patterns and extract the relation between them to introduce a formula using mathematical methods. Further, the resource discovery mechanism uses the formula to predict resources' load before assigning them new processes and thus it prevents resource overloading which happens frequently in computing environments.", "paper_title": "Resource and application-aware resource discovery in computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000350868400004"}
