The EPICURE contribution is the result of a joint study on abstraction/refinement methods and a smart reconfigurable architecture within the formal Esterel design tools suite. The original points of this work are: (i) a generic HW/SW interface model, (ii) a specification methodology that handles the control, and includes efficient verification and HW/SW synthesis capabilities, (iii) a method for parallelism exploration based on abstract resources/performance estimation expressed in terms of area/delay tradeoffs, (iv) a HW/SW partitioning approach that refines the specification into explicit HW configurations and the associated SW control. The EPICURE framework shows how a cooperation of complementary methodologies and CAD tools associated with a relevant architecture can significantly improve the designer productivity, especially in the context of reconfigurable architectures.
