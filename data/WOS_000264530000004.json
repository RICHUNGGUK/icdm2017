However, there is little consensus as to the exact nature of predictive information and processes, or the neural mechanisms that realise them. This paper reviews a host of neural models believed to underlie the learning and deployment of predictive knowledge in a variety of brain regions: neocortex, hippocampus, thalamus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. These are compared and contrasted in order to codify a few basic aspects of neural circuitry and dynamics that appear to be the heart of prediction.", "paper_title": "Predictive models in the brain", "paper_id": "WOS:000264530000004"}
