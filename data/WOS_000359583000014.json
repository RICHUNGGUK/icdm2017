Retargeting these photos is a challenging task since each semantic object has fixed geometric characteristics. Shrinking these objects simultaneously during retargeting is prone to distortion. In this paper, we propose to retarget semantically-rich photos by detecting photo semantics from image tags, which are predicted by a multi-label SVM. The key technique is a generative model termed latent stability discovery (LSD). It can robustly localize various semantic objects in a photo by making use of the predicted noisy image tags. Based on LSD, a feature fusion algorithm is proposed to detect salient regions at both the low-level and high-level. These salient regions are linked into a path sequentially to simulate human visual perception. Finally, we learn the prior distribution of such paths from aesthetically pleasing training photos. The prior enforces the path of a retargeted photo to be maximally similar to those from the training photos. In the experiment, we collect 217 1600 x 1200 photos, each containing over seven salient objects. Comprehensive user studies demonstrate the competitiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Retargeting Semantically-Rich Photos", "paper_id": "WOS:000359583000014"}
