Instead of ignoring this problem, a better way to cope with it is to incorporate the imprecision into the models. This has become possible with the development of models of imprecise probabilities, such as the interval probability model. In this paper we discuss some modelling approaches which range from simple probability intervals to the general interval probability models and further to the models allowing completely general convex sets of probabilities. The basic idea is that precisely known initial distributions and transition matrices are replaced by imprecise ones, which effectively means that sets of possible candidates are considered. Consequently, sets of possible results are obtained and represented using similar imprecise probability models. We first set up the model and then show how to perform calculations of the distributions corresponding to the consecutive steps of a Markov chain. We present several approaches to such calculations and compare them with respect to the accuracy of the results. Next we consider a generalisation of the concept of regularity and study the convergence of regular imprecise Markov chains. We also give some numerical examples to compare different approaches to calculations of the sets of probabilities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
