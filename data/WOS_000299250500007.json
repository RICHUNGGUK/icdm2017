The time delays comprise discrete and distributed interval time-varying delays and the uncertain parameters are norm-bounded. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and linear matrix inequality technique, delay-dependent sufficient conditions are derived for ensuring the exponential stability for the closed-loop fuzzy control system. An important feature of the result is that all the stability conditions are dependent on the upper and lower bounds of the delays, which is made possible by using the proposed techniques for achieving delay dependence. Another feature of the results lies in that involves fewer matrix variables. Two illustrative examples are exploited in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design methods.", "paper_title": "A DELAY-DEPENDENT APPROACH TO ROBUST TAKAGI-SUGENO FUZZY CONTROL OF UNCERTAIN RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS WITH MIXED INTERVAL TIME-VARYING DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299250500007"}
