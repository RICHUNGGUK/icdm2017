Man, T.M. Chan, K.S. Tang, S. Kwong, Jumping-genes in evolutionary computing, in: Proceedings of the IEEE IECON'2004, Busan, 2004, pp, 1268-1272]. JGGA is a relatively new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) that imitates a jumping gene phenomenon discovered by Nobel Laureate McClintock during her work on the corn plants. The main feature of JGGA is that it only has a simple operation in which a transposition of gene(s) is induced within the same or another chromosome in the genetic algorithm (GA) framework. In its initial formulation, the search space solutions are binary-coded and it inherits the customary problems of conventional binary-coded GA (BCGA). This issue motivated us to remodel the JGGA into RJGGA. The performance of RJGGA has been compared to other MOEAs using some carefully chosen benchmark test functions. It has been observed that RJGGA is able to generate non-dominated solutions with a wider spread along the Pareto-optimal front and better address the issues regarding convergence and diversity in multiobjective optimization.
