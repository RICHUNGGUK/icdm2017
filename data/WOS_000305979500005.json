We show how new features (required from a medical point of view) can be provided, which barriers have been identified, and how these factors influence the system's architecture. A turning point in the evolution of our system was the formulation of a new architecture, fully facilitating service-oriented architecture paradigm guidelines. We therefore show how the knowledge and experience gathered during utilization of previous versions of TeleDICOM positively stimulate procedures of service-based system decomposition and business processes definition.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Approach to Development of Collaborative Teleconsultation System for Imaging Medicine", "paper_id": "WOS:000305979500005"}
