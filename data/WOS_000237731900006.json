This article focuses on the reliability quality measure and presents an implementation of a reliability prediction methodology that respects SOC's decentralization and autonomy principles. Despite the focus on reliability, you can extend the architecture to the prediction of other quality measures.", "paper_title": "Reliability prediction for service-oriented computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237731900006"}
