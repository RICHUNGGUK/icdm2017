Our algorithm is designed to produce good results without the need to painstakingly paint over pixels. The ability to edit global illumination through image processing allows interaction with images at a level which has not yet been demonstrated, and significantly augments and extends current image-based material editing approaches. We show by means of a set of psychophysical experiments that the resulting imagery is visually plausible and on par with photon mapping, albeit without the need for hand-modeling the underlying geometry.", "paper_title": "Depicting Procedural Caustics in Single Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100014"}
