A novel enhancement type regulated cascade (ETRGC) configuration with an active inductor is originated in this paper for the transimpedance amplifier to significantly increase the bandwidth. The technique of three-order interleaving active feedback expands the bandwidth of the gain stage of transimpedance amplifier and limiting amplifier. Experimental results show that the output swing is 210 mV (Vpp) when the input voltage varies from 5 mV to 500 mV. The power consumption of the 4-channel parallel 40 Gb/s front-end amplifier (FEA) is 370 mW with 1.8 V power supply and the chip area is 650 mu m x 1300 mu m.", "paper_title": "4-channel, 40 Gb/s front-end amplifier for parallel optical receiver in 0.18 mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400016"}
