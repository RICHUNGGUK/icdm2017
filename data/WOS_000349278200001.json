These simulations support the theory that correlated motion in the flexible beta-sheet structure of the extracellular domain helps to communicate a \"conformational wave\", spreading from the acetylcholine binding pocket. Furthermore, we have identified key residues that act at the interface between subunits and between domains that could potentially facilitate rapid communication between the binding site and the transmembrane gate.
