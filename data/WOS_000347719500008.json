The scheduling service manages transmission resources according to data types, satisfying the requirements of different connections or users. On the basis of the data types defined in the service, we discuss a normalized QoS metric for the multimedia connections in the paper. The QoS value of a connection can be determined just by three components: the data type of the connection, its desired resources, and its allocated resources. Then, we propose an optimum bandwidth allocation solution, which can maximize the utility of base station. Next, we propose a call admission control scheme utilizing the bandwidth allocation solution. In the scheme, the occupied resource of ongoing connections will be regulated for the entry admission of a new connection, without degrading the network performance and the QoS of ongoing connections. Finally, the simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme with the normalized QoS can achieve better trade-off between ongoing connections and new connections.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Call admission control scheme with normalized quality of service metric in IEEE 802.16 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347719500008"}
