The surface tension tensor for the particle-based expression was adequately included as the gradient of the surface tension and that enabled the simulation leading to the formations of crater and crown as well as the consequent central column. The simulated time series of the crater depth and diameter and crown height corresponded quantitatively well with the experimental result up to the rebound motion while discrepancies remained as a lower central column height in the simulation, and this seemed to be ascribed to the difficulty in realizing the complex surface structure that inevitably appeared in the fast rebound motion.
