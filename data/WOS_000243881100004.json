These constructions exploit component codes over GF(2), GF(4),..., GF(2(q)) that are based on shorter Reed-Muller codes and set partitioning using partition chains of length-2(l) codes. Using these constructions we derive multilevel constructions for the Barnes-Wall Lambda (r, m) family of lattices which also use component codes over GF(2), GF(4),..., GF(2q) and set partitioning based on partition chains of length-2(l) lattices. These constructions of Reed-Muller codes and Barnes-Wall lattices are readily applicable for their efficient decoding.", "paper_title": "Reed-Muller codes and Barnes-Wall lattices: Generalized multilevel constructions and representation over GF(2(q))", "paper_id": "WOS:000243881100004"}
