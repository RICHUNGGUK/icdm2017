In order to satisfy the performance requirement while reducing power consumption, a multi-way parallel architecture has been proposed. But the use of the high degree parallel architecture would increase chip resource significantly, thus a resource efficient design is essential. In this paper, we introduce several novel optimization techniques for resource efficient implementation of the baseband modem which has highly, i.e., 8-way, parallel architecture, such as new processing structures for a (de)interleaver and a packet synchronizer and algorithm reconstruction for a carrier frequency offset compensator. Also, we describe how to efficiently design several other components. The detailed analysis shows that our optimization technique could reduce the gate count by 27.6% on average, while none of techniques degraded the overall system performance. With 0.18-mu m CMOS process, the gate count and power consumption of the entire baseband modem were about 785 kgates and less than 381 mW at 66 MHz clock rate, respectively.", "paper_title": "Resource Efficient Implementation of Low Power MB-OFDM PHY Baseband Modem With Highly Parallel Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000305181800009"}
