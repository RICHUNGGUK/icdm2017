The focus of this paper is on the development of methods for determining semantic relatedness in tree-shaped semistructured data and on the assessment of the impact of these methods on structural sense ranking in such data. By exploiting key features of a lexical knowledge base like WordNet, namely ontological relations and concept definitions, we propose a twofold approach that takes into account the particular form of labeled tree data as a conceptual hierarchical representation of real-world objects. We infer indirect relationships between tag concepts and exploit an interleaved search through different concept hierarchies in order to extend semantic relatedness measures originally conceived for plain-text data to deal with labeled tree data instances. We also develop a structural sense ranking framework which employs a context graph built on the tag concepts and the structural relations among tags in the tree data. Experimental evidence on a large real-world collection of Wikipedia articles has shown that the proposed methods can effectively detect and maximize semantic relatedness in tree-structured data, and can be profitably used to perform structural sense ranking.
