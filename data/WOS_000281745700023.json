It aims to support the real-time decision-making processes of disruption management when an unexpected event emerges. The method comprises three components, E, S and R. In the E component, the (Source Type Value) Tree-like structure is created to represent the knowledge for identifying an unexpected Event. In the S component, the (Object State Set) Tree-like structure is invented to represent the distribution system's State. In the I? component, Production Rules are used to represent the Rules for judging if an event can result in a disturbance. Examples show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in real-time decision-making support. The research result can support real-time reasoning and modeling for disruption management problems in urban distribution systems.", "paper_title": "KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION FOR DISRUPTION MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IN URBAN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700023"}
