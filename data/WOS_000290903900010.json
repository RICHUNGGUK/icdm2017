A commonly used modelling approach is based on the assessment of land cover probabilities by means of logistic regression equations. In most cases, however, the error involved in the parameterization of logistic regression equations is not known. In this article, the sensitivity of logistic regression parameterization for land use and land cover probability assessments is analysed by comparing the results using input maps from different sources. Land cover maps with a range of accuracy levels were collected for a sub-catchment of the Lake Balaton watershed in Hungary. The results show that the parameterization of the logistic regression coefficients is highly dependent on the quality of the input maps. Both the spatial pattern and the area covered by a specific land cover type have a direct influence on the error propagation in the land cover probability maps. These findings should be taken into account when interpreting the results of land use and land cover change models at regional- and national-scale levels.", "paper_title": "Sensitivity analysis of logistic regression parameterization for land use and land cover probability estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290903900010"}
