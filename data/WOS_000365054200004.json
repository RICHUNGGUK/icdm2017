We operationalize relational governance with inter-firm dependence and inter-firm trust to build a structural model. The empirical analysis of our survey data collected from manufacturing firms reveals that e-business integration significantly mediates the effects of inter-firm dependence and inter-firm trust on operational performance. The present work justifies the mediating mechanism of e-business integration and advances the understanding of the impact of relational governance on operational performance. The findings contribute to research and practice in e-business and supply chain management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
