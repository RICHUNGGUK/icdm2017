When standard density-based topology optimization methods are used for nonlinear dynamic problems, they typically suffer from two main numerical difficulties, element instability and localized vibration modes. As an alterative approach, the I-ECP method is employed to avoid element instability and a new patch mass model in the I-ECP formulation is developed to control the problem of localized vibration modes. After the I-ECP based formulation is developed. the advantages of the proposed method are checked with several numerical examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
