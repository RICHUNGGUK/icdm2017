The objective is to adjust the cutting speed as a function of remaining distance, each time a tool change occurs, in order to minimize the expected processing time (sum of cutting and tool setup time). We address the computational aspects of finding optimal decision rules and we present numerical results suggesting that easily computed decision rules of a simple static model are near-optimal for our dynamic programming model. Dynamic adjustment is assessed with simulation experiments.", "paper_title": "Dynamic speed control of a machine tool with stochastic tool life: analysis and simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800025"}
