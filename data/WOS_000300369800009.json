After recovering from the previous failure, if failure occurs again, unprotected or vulnerable lightpaths cannot be recovered. In this paper, the minimal backup reprovisioning (MBR) problem is studied, in which the failure-independent path protecting p-cycles (FIPP p-cycles) scheme is considered for single-node failure on WDM networks. After recovering the affected lightpaths from a node failure, the goal of the MBR is to re-arrange the protecting and available resources such that working paths can be protected against next node failure if possible. An algorithm is designed to recover the protecting capabilities of the FIPP p-cycles, unless there is no sufficient network resource. The simulation results of the proposed method are also given.", "paper_title": "The backup reprovisioning problem of FIPP p-cycles for node failure on survivable WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300369800009"}
