In this paper, the new approach has been proposed for easy and effective monitoring, modeling, prediction, and control of the braking process i.e. the brake performance during a braking cycle. The context based control of the disc brake actuation pressure was used for improving the dynamic control of braking process versus influence of the previous and current values of the disc brake actuation pressure, the vehicle speed, and the brake interface temperature. For these purposes, two different dynamic neural models have been developed and integrated into the microcontroller. Microcontrollers are resource intensive and cost effective platforms that offer possibilities to associate with commonly used artificial intelligence techniques. The neural models, based on recurrent dynamic neural networks, are implemented in 8-bit CMOS microcontroller for control of the disc brake actuation pressure during a braking cycle. The first neural model was used for modeling and prediction of the braking process output (braking torque). Based on such acquired knowledge about the real brake operation, the inverse neural model has been developed which was able to predict the brake actuation pressure needed for achieving previously selected (desired) braking torque value in accordance with the previous and current influence of the pressure, speed, and the brake interface temperature. Both neural models have had inherent abilities for on-line learning and prediction during each braking cycle and an intelligent adaptation to the change of influences of pressure, speed, and temperature on the braking process.
