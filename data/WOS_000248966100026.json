Each vertex of T is assigned a state either lit or off. An assignment of states to all the vertices of T is called a configuration. The lit-only a-game allows the player to pick a lit vertex and change the states of all its neighbours. We prove that for any initial configuration one can make a sequence of allowable moves to arrive at a configuration in which the number of lit vertices is no greater than [l/2] - We also give examples to show that the bound F l cannot be relaxed to L-e (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
