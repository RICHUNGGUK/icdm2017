Our model incorporates the important aspects of cloud centers such as pool management, compound requests (i.e., a set of requests submitted by one user simultaneously), resource virtualization and realistic servicing steps. In this manner, we obtain not only a detailed assessment of cloud center performance, but also clear insights into equilibrium arrangement and capacity planning that allows servicing delays, task rejection probability, and power consumption to be kept under control.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a Pool Management Scheme for Cloud Computing Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000316754600001"}
