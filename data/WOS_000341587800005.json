By combining deductive and inductive stream reasoning techniques with visitor-modeling functionalities, this system semantically analyzes and links visitors' social network activities to produce high-quality link predictions when information about preferences is sparse. The authors demonstrate their system's quality with experiments on real-world data.", "paper_title": "Recommending Venues Using Continuous Predictive Social Media Analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000341587800005"}
