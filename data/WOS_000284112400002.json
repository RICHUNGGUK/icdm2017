Our method is based on computing and merging depth maps. Different from previous methods of this category, the silhouette information is also applied in our algorithm to recover the shape information on the textureless and occluded areas. The proposed algorithm starts by computing visual hull using a volumetric method in which a novel projection test method is proposed for visual hull octree construction. Then, the depth map of each image is estimated by an expansion-based approach that returns a 3D point cloud with outliers and redundant information. After generating an oriented point cloud from stereo by rejecting outlier, reducing scale, and estimating surface normal for the depth maps, another oriented point cloud from silhouette is added by carving the visual hull octree structure using the point cloud from stereo to restore the textureless and occluded surfaces. Finally, Poisson Surface Reconstruction approach is applied to convert the oriented point cloud both from stereo and silhouette into a complete and accurate triangulated mesh model. The proposed approach has been implemented and the performance of the approach is demonstrated on several real data sets, along with qualitative comparisons with the state-of-the-art image-based modeling techniques according to the Middlebury benchmark.", "paper_title": "Volumetric stereo and silhouette fusion for image-based modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000284112400002"}
