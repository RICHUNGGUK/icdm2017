In this paper. mathematical models are developed for passive liquid spring shock absorbers. The preloading is achieved by mounting the load between two liquid spring/dampers. Dynamics of such shock absorbers involve coupled hydrodynamic and thermodynamic phenomena. The energy dissipated through orifice due to hydrodynamic losses heats LIP the working fluid and consequently the heat is dissipated to environment. Such multi-energy domain interaction is well represented in this paper by using bond graph models. Moreover, the developed model accounts for the strain-rate dependent damping offered by the compressible working fluid in the liquid spring. The results show that proper choice of preloading and geometric parameters (spring dimensions and orifice sizes) can. respectively, reduce the thermodynamic and strain-rate dependent damping phenomena.
