By taking advantage of the continuous bid property of TMG and after some improvements, the modified TMG-based scheme we proposed herein can work well when the resources are divisible and capacity is dynamic. Compared with existing Minority Game (MG)-based methods, actions of users in the proposed scheme are no longer confined to be binary. Meanwhile, users in the scheme are capable to follow the capacity changes well. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, a number of simulations are carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can work well in both single and multiple resources with either fixed or time-varying resource channels.", "paper_title": "A Thermal Minority Game-Based Distributed Resource Allocation Scheme with Time-Varying Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000322851600006"}
