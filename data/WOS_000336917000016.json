An adaptive neural network (NN) consensus control method for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems with state time-delay is proposed in this paper. The approximation property of radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) is used to neutralize the uncertain nonlinear dynamics in agents. An appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which is obtained from the derivative of an appropriate Lyapunov function, is used to compensate the uncertainties of unknown time delays. It is proved that our proposed approach guarantees the convergence on the basis of Lyapunov stability theory. The simulation results of a nonlinear multiagent time-delay system and a multiple collaborative manipulators system show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus control algorithm.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Consensus Control for a Class of Nonlinear Multiagent Time-Delay Systems Using Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336917000016"}
