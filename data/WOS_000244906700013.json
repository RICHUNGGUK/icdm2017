The framework is developed using standard Grid technologies, and has two distinctive features: (1) an extended GridRPC API to conceal the high complexity of the Grid environment, and (2) a metascheduler for seamless resource discovery and selection. To assess the practicality of the framework, a theoretical analysis of the possible speed-up offered is presented. An empirical study on GE-HPGA using a benchmark problem and a realistic aerodynamic airfoil shape optimization problem for diverse Grid environments having different communication protocols, cluster sizes, processing nodes, at geographically disparate locations also indicates that the proposed GE-HPGA using Grid computing offers a credible framework for providing a significant speed-up to evolutionary design optimization in science and engineering.
