Among these studies, researchers have indicated that adaptive learning is a critical requirement for promoting the learning performance of students. Adaptive learning provides adaptive learning materials, learning strategies and/or courses according to a student's learning style. Hence, the first step for achieving adaptive learning environments is to identify students' learning styles. This paper proposes a learning style classification mechanism to classify and then identify students' learning styles. The proposed mechanism improves k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classification and combines it with genetic algorithms (GA). To demonstrate the viability of the proposed mechanism, the proposed mechanism is implemented on an open-learning management system. The learning behavioral features of 117 elementary school students are collected and then classified by the proposed mechanism. The experimental results indicate that the proposed classification mechanism can effectively classify and identify Students' learning styles. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
