In this paper, we focus on a different technique for maintaining consistent graphs-Chord's successor sets and periodic stabilizations-under both static and dynamic node failure. We derive closed-form models for the probability that Chord remains connected under both types of node failure and show the effect of using different stabilization interval lengths (i.e., exponential, uniform, and constant) on the probability of partitioning in Chord.", "paper_title": "Understanding Disconnection and Stabilization of Chord", "paper_id": "WOS:000287580000010"}
