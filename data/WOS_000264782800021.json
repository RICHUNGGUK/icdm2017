In these areas, agriculture is the primary sector in supporting their economies, where a number of the relevant production and processing practices cause many adverse impacts on environment and ecosystem. This poses many challenges for decision makers in formulating sustainable development strategies without invoking potential controversies or objections from the public. In this study, a two-level expert system (TES) for facilitating the investigation of public's perception towards sustainable development in rural areas was developed. Interactive relationships among objectives of socio-economic development and environmental protection, as well as the related policy implications and public responses, were comprehensively examined and incorporated within TES. A two-level system was particularly adopted for facilitating participation of various stakeholders, including decision makers and farmers. The Yongxin County of the Shanjianghu Region in Jiangxi Province. China was selected to demonstrate the applicability of the developed TES. A series of questionnaire surveys were conducted both for acquiring knowledge about the interrelationships among sustainable development, agricultural production, poverty reduction and environmental protection. Public's perception towards various system components of rural sustainable development were efficiently acquired and analyzed. The results indicated that sustainable development would he very significant oil rural areas in China. Also, public awareness to the concept and profile of rural sustainable development was still at a low level, especially for farmers. The developed TES can be not only used for acquiring knowledge of sustain able development, but also providing basic information for the formulation of relevant policies and strategies in rural areas of China.
