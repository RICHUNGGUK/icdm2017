However, currently we still know very little about their functions. Therefore, a lincRNA function annotation database is needed to facilitate the study in this field. In this article, we present Linc2GO, a web resource that aims to provide comprehensive functional annotations for human lincRNA. MicroRNA-mRNA and microRNA-lincRNA interaction data were integrated to generate lincRNA functional annotations based on the 'competing endogenous RNA hypothesis'. To the best of our knowledge, Linc2GO is the first database that makes use of the 'competing endogenous RNA hypothesis' to predict lincRNA functions.", "paper_title": "Linc2GO: a human LincRNA function annotation resource based on ceRNA hypothesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000323344800026"}
