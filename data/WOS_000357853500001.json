Since equal order interpolation is used for all degrees of freedom, Galerkin/least-squares stabilization is applied. We give a detailed derivation of the equations involved, introduce the variational form, present the stabilization parameters, and also discuss implementation issues. Numerical examples in 2D and 3D show generality and efficiency of the method, if steady-state behavior of rotating components is sufficient for the CFD analysis.
