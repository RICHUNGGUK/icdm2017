The set of still images obtained this way is rich in dynamic content but lacks accurate temporal information. We propose a method for photo-sequencing-temporally ordering a set of still images taken asynchronously by a set of uncalibrated cameras. Photo-sequencing is an essential tool in analyzing (or visualizing) a dynamic scene captured by still images. The first step of the method detects sets of corresponding static and dynamic feature points across images. The static features are used to determine the epipolar geometry between pairs of images, and each dynamic feature votes for the temporal order of the images in which it appears. The partial orders provided by the dynamic features are not necessarily consistent, and we use rank aggregation to combine them into a globally consistent temporal order of images. We demonstrate successful photo-sequencing on several challenging collections of images taken using a number of mobile phones.", "paper_title": "Photo Sequencing", "paper_id": "WOS:000344754500004"}
