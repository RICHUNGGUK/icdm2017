Most heuristics for this NP-hard problem assume fully connected homogeneous processors and ignore contention on the communication links. Actually, contention for communication resources has a strong influence on the execution time of a parallel program in arbitrary network topology heterogeneous system. This paper investigates the incorporation of contention awareness into task scheduling. The innovation is the idea of dynamic scheduling edges to links, which we use the earliest communication finish time search algorithm based on shortest-path search algorithm. The other novel idea proposed in this paper is scheduling priority based on recursive rank computation on heterogeneous arbitrary architectures. The comparison study, based on randomly generated graphs, shows that our scheduling algorithm significantly surpass classic and static communication contention awareness algorithm, especially for high data transmission rate parallel application.", "paper_title": "A dynamic communication contention awareness list scheduling algorithm for arbitrary heterogeneous system", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318600019"}
