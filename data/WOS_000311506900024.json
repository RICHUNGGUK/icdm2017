In this paper, an enhanced FFNN, EFFNN, is proposed for time series forecasting and material fatigue prognosis. A novel neural network scheme is developed to facilitate computation implementation. A new conjugate technique is proposed to improve training efficiency. The effectiveness of the developed EFFNN scheme and the related training technique is demonstrated by a series of simulation tests. The EFFNN is also implemented for material fatigue prognosis. Test results show that the developed EFFNN predictor is an effective forecasting tool; it can capture system dynamics effectively and track system characteristics accurately. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
