CP systems with finite domain constraints usually employ Constraint Satisfaction Problem(s)-based solvers which use local consistency, for example, arc consistency. We introduce a new approach which is based instead on variable substitution. We obtain efficient algorithms for reducing systems involving functional and bi-functional constraints together with other nonfunctional constraints. It also solves globally any CSP where there exists a variable such that any other variable is reachable from it through a sequence of functional constraints. Our experiments on random problems show that variable elimination can significantly improve the efficiency of solving problems with functional constraints.", "paper_title": "Solving functional constraints by variable substitution", "paper_id": "WOS:000287977500007"}
