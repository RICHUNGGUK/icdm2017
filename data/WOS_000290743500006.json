The analysis shows that NRA needs to maintain a large quantity of candidate tuples in growing phase on massive data. Based on the analysis, this paper proposes a novel top-k algorithm Top-K with Early Pruning (TKEP) which performs early pruning in growing phase. General rule and mathematical analysis for early pruning are presented in this paper. The theoretical analysis shows that early pruning can prune most of the candidate tuples. Although TKEP is an approximate method to obtain the top-k result, the probability for correctness is extremely high. Extensive experiments show that TKEP has a significant advantage over NRA.
