It is concluded from a careful analysis of the derived closed form solutions that linear quadratic regulator (LQR) performance which corresponds to white noise assumption is the best performance of the sub-optimal minimax control (OMC) although it is also the worst performance of the OMC and the disturbance weighting parameter is as a measure of the system stability. For the completeness of the article, OMC is also compared to LQR and unimplementable optimal control.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Disturbance Weighting Parameter of Minimax Attenuation Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264081700006"}
