However, once a user applies a mobile agent to execute his task on the Internet, the mobile agent exposes itself to danger. This is an obstacle when using mobile agents. It is, therefore, urgent to build up a secure structure for mobile agents. In this paper, a new structure is suitable for mobile agents on the basis of improving the tree-based scheme. In the novel structure, the concept of access control and a key assignment scheme are used to ensure the privacy of the data being transmitted. To convenient the computation in the key generation phase, we use the ID-based characteristics in bilinear pairings over elliptic curves to construct a hierarchical key management scheme. Moreover, the concept of time sensitive is integrated into our scheme, which ensures our scheme more secure and more efficient. Finally, from our security analysis, the new scheme should be able to resist malicious attacks, promote the key management efficiency and protect mobile agents.", "paper_title": "THE DESIGN OF ID-BASED ACCESS CONTROL SYSTEM WITH TIME-SENSITIVE KEY FOR MOBILE AGENT'S MIGRATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500033"}
