We present a new method for performing ab initio inference of the 3D structures of macromolecules from single particle electron cryo-microscopy experiments using class average images. Results: We demonstrate this algorithm on one phantom, one synthetic dataset and three real (experimental) datasets (ATP synthase, V-type ATPase and GroEL). Structures consistent with the known structures were inferred for all datasets.", "paper_title": "A Bayesian method for 3D macromolecular structure inference using class average images from single particle electron microscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000282170000007"}
