The probability distributions of the gray levels in the different regions of the image are described with step functions with parameters that are estimated. The segmentation is thus obtained by minimizing a criterion that does not include any parameter to be tuned by the user. We illustrate the robustness of this technique on various types of images with level set and polygonal contour models. The efficiency of this approach is also analyzed in comparison with parametric statistical techniques.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric statistical, snake based on the minimum stochastic complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000239774800027"}
