Based on the maximization of energy dissipation due to active control action, a mathematical model with constrains is initially developed. Then, according to the characteristics of the optimal problem, a new problem-specific encoding scheme, some special \"genetic\" operators and a problem-dependent repair algorithm are proposed and discussed. Numerical example of a 72-bar space intelligent truss structure is presented to demonstrate the rationality and validity of this methodology, and some useful conclusions are obtained.", "paper_title": "A novel constrained genetic algorithm for the optimization of active bar placement and feedback gains in intelligent truss structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000101"}
