The developed solution uses multiple GPUs to tackle the compute bound steps of the FMM (aggregation, disaggregation, and near interactions) while the CPU handles a memory bound step (translation) using OpenMP. The proposed solver performance is measured on a workstation with two GPUs (NVIDIA GTX 480) and is compared with that of a distributed memory solver run on a cluster of 32 nodes (HP BL465c) with an lnfiniband network. Some energy efficiency results are also presented in this work. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
