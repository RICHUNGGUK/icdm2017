The mutual information achievable over AEN channels with both coded modulation (CM) and bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) approaches is evaluated for various signal sets via computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Capacity-Approaching Signal Constellations for the Additive Exponential Noise Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200015"}
