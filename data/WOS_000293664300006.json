An FMO explicit map is generated frame-by-frame by using prior information. This information involves estimated locations of guard and burst sections in the channel and estimated effect of error propagation (EEP) from the previous frame to the current frame. In addition, the role of the current frame in propagating an error to the next frame is also considered. A suitable intra refresh rate which is adaptive to the channel state is used to reduce the dependence between frames and thus can stop the EEP. The results in experiments show that the proposed method gains some improvements in terms of peak signal-to-noise rate (PSNR) as compared with some other methods that have not considered the channel condition and the error propagation in generating an FMO map.", "paper_title": "New Error Resilience Technique Using Adaptive FMO and Intra Refresh for H.264 Video Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664300006"}
