An L-length-bounded flow is a flow in which only flow paths of length at most L are used. We show that the minimum length-bounded cut problem in graphs with unit edge lengths is MP-hard to approximate within a factor of at least 1.1377 for L >= 5 in the case of node-cuts and for L >= 4 in the case of edge-cuts. We also give approximation algorithms of ratio min {L, n/L} in the node case and min {L, n(2)/L(2), root m} in the edge case, where n denotes the number of nodes and m denotes the number of edges. We discuss the integrality gaps of the LP relaxations of length-bounded flow and cut problems, analyze the structure of optimal solutions, and present further complexity results for special cases.", "paper_title": "Length-bounded cuts and flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500059"}
