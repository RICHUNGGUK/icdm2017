Under this framework, an algorithm implementation based on image multi-domain features merging and BP (Back-Propagation) neural network is presented. A series of experiments are made for four kinds of typical steganogrophy methods of BMP images and JPEG images respectively. Results validate that the presented algorithm is reliable and the proposed blind detection system has higher detection accuracy and wider applicability than some existing classical blind steganalysis methods.", "paper_title": "BLIND DETECTION FOR IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY: A SYSTEM FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500018"}
