In this framework, the 4D spatiotemporal registration is decoupled into a 4D temporal registration, defined as mapping physiological states, and a 4D spatial registration, defined as mapping trajectories of physical points. Our contribution focuses more specifically on the 4D spatial registration that should be consistent over time as opposed to 3D registration that solely aims at mapping homologous points at a given time-point. First, we estimate in each sequence the motion displacement field, which is a dense representation of the point trajectories we want to register. Then, we perform simultaneously 3D registrations of corresponding time-points with the constraints to map the same physical points over time called the trajectory constraints. Under these constraints, we show that the 4D spatial registration can be formulated as a multichannel registration of 3D images. To solve it, we propose a novel version of the Diffeomorphic Demons (DD) algorithm extended to vector-valued 3D images, the Multichannel Diffeomorphic Demons (MDD). For evaluation, this framework is applied to the registration of 4D cardiac computed tomography (CT) sequences and compared to other standard methods with real patient data and synthetic data simulated from a physiologically realistic electromechanical cardiac model. Results show that the trajectory constraints act as a temporal regularization consistent with motion whereas the multichannel registration acts as a spatial regularization. Finally, using these trajectory constraints with multichannel registration yields the best compromise between registration accuracy, temporal and spatial smoothness, and computation times. A prospective example of application is also presented with the spatiotemporal registration of 4D cardiac CT sequences of the same patient before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in case of atrial fibrillation (AF). The intersequence spatial transformations over a cardiac cycle allow to analyze and quantify the regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and its impact on the cardiac function.", "paper_title": "Registration of 4D Cardiac CT Sequences Under Trajectory Constraints With Multichannel Diffeomorphic Demons", "paper_id": "WOS:000281925700002"}
