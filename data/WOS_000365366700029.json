The sideslip angle is an important signal for the vehicle lateral stability, which is not measurable by using an affordable physical sensor. Therefore, we aim to estimate the sideslip angle with the yaw rate measurements by employing the vehicle dynamics. The nonlinear lateral dynamics is modeled firstly. As the tyre model is nonlinear and the road adhesive coefficient is subject to a large variation, the nonlinear lateral dynamics is transformed into an uncertain model. Considering the variation of longitudinal velocity, an uncertain linear-parameter-varying (LPV) system is obtained. Based on the LPV model, a gain-scheduling observer is proposed and the observer gain can be determined with off-line computation and on-line computation. The off-line computation includes the calculation of a set of linear matrix inequalities and the on-line computation contains several algebraic operations. The proposed design methodology is applied to a four-wheel-independent-drive electric vehicle in simulation. It infers from different maneuvers that the designed observer has a good performance on estimating the sideslip angle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
