A simple and non problem-dependent technique is incorporated into OEA to handle the constraints. In OEA, a population consists of organizations, and an organization consists of individuals. All evolutionary operators are designed to simulate the interaction among organizations. In experiments, 4 well-studied engineering design problems are used to test the performance of OEA. The results show that OEA obtains good results both in the solution quality and the computational cost.", "paper_title": "Constrained optimization using Organizational Evolutionary Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300039"}
