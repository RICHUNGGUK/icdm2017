In structural modelling, the plate/shell and the stiffeners are treated as separate elements where the displacement compatibility transformation between these two types of elements takes into account the constraint torsional warping effect in the stiffeners. The development is based on a general beam theory which includes flexural-torsion coupling, constrained torsion warping, and shear-centre location. The virtual work principle includes the second order terms of finite beam rotations. For finite element analysis, cubic Hermitian polynomials are used as shape functions of the straight space frame element with two nodes. Elastic stiffness and geometric stiffness matrices for an arbitrary cross-section are evaluated in a closed form, and load correction stiffness for eccentric stiffener loads are considered. To demonstrate the importance of torsion warping constraints and to illustrate the accuracy of this formulation, finite element solutions are presented and compared with available solutions.
