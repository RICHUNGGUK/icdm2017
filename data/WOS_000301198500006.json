Let X-1:n, X-2:n,..., X-n:n denote the ordered lifetimes of the components of a coherent system consisting of n i.i.d components. If denotes the lifetime of the system, then the signature vector of the system is defined to be a probability vector s = (s(1), s(2),..., s(n)) such that s(i) - P(T = X-i:n), i = 1, 2,..., n. Here we consider a coherent system with signature of the form s = (s(1), s(2),...,s(i), 0..., 0), where s(k) > 0, k = 1, 2,..., i. Under the condition that the system is working at time, we propose a time dependent measure to calculate the probability of residual life of live components of the system, i.e., X-k:n, k = i + 1,..., n. Several stochastic and aging properties of the proposed measure are explored.", "paper_title": "A Proposed Measure of Residual Life of Live Components of a Coherent System", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198500006"}
