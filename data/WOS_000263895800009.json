In this article we investigate the properties of and operations on these tables. We use known techniques for combining tables to correct a table in the literature; give a necessary and sufficient condition for a table to correspond to some tree property; discuss the question of dividing one table by another; explain how to derive a table from a set of representatives; and apply this to finding the table for the parameter external redundance. All of this is facilitated by computer software. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
