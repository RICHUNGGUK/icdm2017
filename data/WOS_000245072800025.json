These themes have included upstream R&D pipeline management, planning and scheduling in batch and continuous manufacturing systems and more recently supply chain optimization under uncertainty. In reality, the modem process enterprise functions as a cohesive entity involving several degrees of cross-functional co-ordination across enterprise planning and process functions. The complex organizational structures underlying horizontally and vertically integrated process enterprises challenge our understanding of cross-functional co-ordination and its business impact. This article looks at the impact of enterprise-wide cross-functional coordination on enterprise performance, sustainability and growth prospects. Cross-functional coordination is defined as the integration of strategic and tactical decision-making processes involving the control of financial and inventory flows (both internal and external) as well as resource deployments. Initially, we demonstrate the existence of cross-functional decision-making dependencies using an enterprise network model. Subsequently, we discuss interactions between enterprise planning decisions involving project financing, debt-equity balancing, R&D portfolio selection, risk hedging with real derivative instruments, supply chain asset creation and marketing contracts which influence decision-making at the activity/process level. Several case studies are included to re-enforce the point that planning and process decisions need to be integrated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
