We present a novel distributed algorithm for estimating and tracking the local evolution characteristics of continuous objects. The hazard's front line is approximated as a set of line segments, and the spatiotemporal evolution of each segment is modeled by a small number of parameters (orientation, direction and speed of motion). As the hazard approaches, these parameters are re-estimated using ad-hoc clusters (triplets) of collaborating sensor nodes. Parameters updating is based on algebraic closed-form expressions resulting from the analytical solution of a Bayesian estimation problem. Therefore, it can be implemented by microprocessors of the WSN nodes, while respecting their limited processing capabilities and strict energy constraints. Extensive computer simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed distributed algorithm to estimate accurately the evolution characteristics of complex hazard fronts under different conditions by using reasonably dense WSNs. The proposed in-network processing scheme does not require sensor node clocks synchronization and is shown to be robust to sensor node failures and communication link failures, which are expected in harsh environments.", "paper_title": "Estimating the Spatiotemporal Evolution Characteristics of Diffusive Hazards Using Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361640800007"}
