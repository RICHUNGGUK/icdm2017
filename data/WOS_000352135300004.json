Several published articles on tree loss models are discussed. The presented simulations are based on the Lee propagation model, which is flexible to include vegetation losses, taking into consideration the particularities of the WSN. Simulation results are contrasted with levels of received power obtained from 2.4 GHz field measurements conducted in an academic environment. Results are analysed in terms of absolute average deviation and root mean square errors. The simulation platform includes a Lidar database in order to account the buildings and trees heights.", "paper_title": "Some guidelines to simulate wireless sensor networks in a propagation environment with non-uniform vegetation", "paper_id": "WOS:000352135300004"}
