In this paper, we propose a hierarchial particle swarm optimization (PSO) for solving general BLPPs. Unlike most traditional algorithms designed for specific versions or based on specific assumptions, the proposed method is a hierarchical algorithm framework, which solves the general bilevel programming problems directly by simulating the decision process of bilevel programming. The solving general BLPPs is transformed to solve the upper-level and lower-level problems iteratively by two variants of PSO. The variants of PSO are built to solve upper-level and lower-level constrained optimization problems. The experimental results compared with those of other methods show that the proposed algorithm is a competitive method for solving general BLPPs.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical particle swarm optimization for solving bilevel programming problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000122"}
