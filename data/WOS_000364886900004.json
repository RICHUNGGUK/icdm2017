In this paper, we propose fast and stable explicit operator splitting methods for both one- and two-dimensional nonlinear diffusion equations for thin film epitaxy with slope selection and the Cahn-Hilliard equation. The equations are split into nonlinear and linear parts. The nonlinear part is solved using a method of lines together with an efficient large stability domain explicit ODE solver. The linear part is solved by a pseudo-spectral method, which is based on the exact solution and thus has no stability restriction on the time-step size. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods on a number of one- and two-dimensional numerical examples, where different stages of coarsening such as the initial preparation, alternating rapid structural transition and slow motion can be clearly observed.
