In this letter, we propose a novel TRNG which generates random bits by moving the mouse casually. It is convenient, universal and low-cost for the personal computer (PC) platform. To eliminate the regular patterns of mouse movements caused by the habit of the same user, we propose three TRNGs based on chaotic hash functions. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the speed, diffusion and randomness performance of these TRNGs. The results show that two of them possess satisfactory performance and can be implemented on common PC platform. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.
