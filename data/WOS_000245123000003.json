The survey was initiated by the Software Process Improvement (SPI) Steering Committee of Philips, a committee that monitors the status and quality of software process improvement in the global organization. The paper presents and discusses improvement targets, improvement drivers, and metrics, and the degree to that they are being recognized in the software groups. The improvement targets 'increase predictability' and 'reduce defects' are being recognized as specifically important, joined for Capability Maturity Model (CMM) level three groups by 'increase productivity' and 'reduce lead time'. The set of improvement drivers that was used in the survey appears to be valid. Three improvement drivers that were rated highest were: 'commitment of engineering management', 'commitment of development staff, and 'sense of urgency'. Finally, it could be seen that metrics activity, both in size and in quality, increases significantly for CMM level three groups. However, no consensus regarding what metrics should be used can be seen.", "paper_title": "Targets, drivers and metrics in software process improvement: Results of a survey in a multinational organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000245123000003"}
