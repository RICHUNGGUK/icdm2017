Faced with mass cloud services, trust and reputation mechanisms offer a promising way to solve the trust evaluation of cloud services. Hence, trust and reputation play an important role in evaluation of cloud services. In this paper, we propose a lightweight reputation measurement approach for cloud services based on (user) feedback ratings. The proposed approach first adopts cloud model to obtain the trust vector of each cloud service by exploiting feedback ratings. The trust vector consists of expected value, entropy value and hyper-entropy value. Then we use the fuzzy set theory to calculate the reputation scores of cloud services. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is significantly effective for unstable feedback ratings.", "paper_title": "Reputation measurement of cloud services based on unstable feedback ratings", "paper_id": "WOS:000364816800002"}
