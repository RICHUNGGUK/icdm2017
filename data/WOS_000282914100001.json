A piconet is basically a collection of slaves controlled by a master. A scatternet, on the other hand, is established by linking several piconets together in an ad hoc fashion to yield a global wireless ad hoc network. This paper proposes a scheduling policy that aims to achieve increased system throughput and reduced packet delays while providing reasonably good fairness among all traffic flows in bluetooth piconets and scatternets. We propose a novel algorithm for scheduling slots to slaves for both piconets and scatternets using multi-layered parameterized policies. Our scheduling scheme works with real data and obtains an optimal feedback policy within prescribed parameterized classes of these by using an efficient two-timescale simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. We show the convergence of our algorithm to an optimal multi-layered policy. We also propose novel polling schemes for intra- and inter-piconet scheduling that are seen to perform well. We present an extensive set of simulation results and performance comparisons with existing scheduling algorithms. Our results indicate that our proposed scheduling algorithm performs better overall on a wide range of experiments over the existing algorithms for both piconets (Das et al. in INFOCOM, pp. 591-600, 2001; Lapeyrie and Turletti in INFOCOM conference proceedings, San Francisco, US, 2003; Shreedhar and Varghese in SIGCOMM, pp. 231-242, 1995) and scatternets (Har-Shai et al. in OPNET-WORK, 2002; Saha and Matsumot in AICT/ICIW, 2006; Tan and Guttag in The 27th annual IEEE conference on local computer networks(LCN). Tampa, 2002). Our studies also confirm that our proposed scheme achieves a high throughput and low packet delays with reasonable fairness among all the connections.", "paper_title": "An efficient algorithm for scheduling in bluetooth piconets and scatternets", "paper_id": "WOS:000282914100001"}
