Currently, dedicated path protection (or 1 + 1) is implemented in backbone networks to provide the necessary resilience and instantaneous recovery against single link failures with remarkable simplicity. However, in order to satisfy strict availability requirements, connections also have to be resilient against Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) failures. In addition, switching matrix reconfigurations have to be avoided after a failure in order to guarantee instantaneous recovery. For this purpose, there are several possible realization strategies improving the characteristics of traditional 1 + 1 path protection by lowering reserved bandwidth while conserving all its favorable properties. These methods either utilize diversity coding, network coding, or generalize the disjoint-path constraint of 1 + 1. In this paper, we consider the cost aspect of the traditional and the alternative 1 + 1 realization strategies. We evaluate the bandwidth cost of different schemes both analytically and empirically in realistic network topologies. As the more complex realizations lead to NP-complete problems even in the single link failure case, we propose both Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based optimal methods, as well as heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches to solve them. Our findings provide a tool and guidelines for service providers for selecting the path protection method with the lowest bandwidth cost for their network corresponding to a given level of reliability.
