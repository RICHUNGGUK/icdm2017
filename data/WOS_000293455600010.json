Many volume rendering approaches proposed so far for voxels classification have been limited in a single global transfer function, which is in general unable to properly visualize interesting structures. In this paper, we propose a localized volume data visualization approach which regards volume visualization as a combination of two mutually related processes: the segmentation of interesting structures and the visualization using a locally designed transfer function for each individual structure of interest. As shown in our work, a new interactive segmentation algorithm is advanced via skeletons to properly categorize interesting structures. In addition, a localized transfer function is subsequently presented to assign visual parameters via interesting information such as intensity, thickness, and distance. As can be seen from the experimental results, the proposed techniques allow us to appropriately visualize interesting structures in highly complex volume medical data sets.", "paper_title": "Skeleton Cuts-An Efficient Segmentation Method for Volume Rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000293455600010"}
