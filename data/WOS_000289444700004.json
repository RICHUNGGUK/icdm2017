We contend that the advent of wireless technologies during the past decade has turned computer networks increasingly complex to manage. In particular, factors such as context awareness and user mobility are now crucial in the design of communications protocols used by portable devices with moderate to severe bandwidth and battery power limitations. Unlike hard-coded communication protocols that fulfill a specific need, mobile software agents can be deployed to deal with a range of tasks and can be designed to efficiently adapt to diverse circumstances. We present our latest advancements in the areas of mobile ad hoc networking and wireless sensor networks using mobile agents (MAs). We also elaborate on the importance of engineering an efficient migration strategy as the single most distinctive proceeding that an MA performs to operate efficiently. In addition, we describe the Wiseman system for scripting MAs that can perform networking tasks in both homogeneous and heterogeneous wireless network environments. Monitoring, tracking, and E-healthcare applications are discussed and evaluated at length.", "paper_title": "Applications of Mobile Agents in Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000289444700004"}
