The language contains features such as simple and structured data types, structuring mechanisms like parallel composition and abstraction, means to control the granularity of assignments, exception handling, and nondeterministic and random branching and timing. MODEST can be viewed as an overarching notation for a wide spectrum of models, ranging from labeled transition systems to timed automata (and probabilistic variants thereof), as well as prominent stochastic processes such as (generalized semi-) Markov chains and decision processes. The paper describes the design rationales and details of the syntax and semantics.", "paper_title": "MODEST: A compositional modeling formalism for hard and softly timed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241385700004"}
