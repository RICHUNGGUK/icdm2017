There is still, however, a lack of scalable approaches to developing and verifying systems with complex mode transitions. This paper presents an approach to the formal development of mode-rich systems by refinement in Event-B. We formalise the concepts of modes and mode transitions as well as deriving specification and refinement patterns which support correct-by-construction system development. The proposed approach is validated by a formal development of the Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) undertaken within the ICT DEPLOY project. The experience gained in the course of developing such a complex industrial system as AOCS, shows that Event-B refinement provides the engineers with a scalable formal technique. Moreover, the case study has demonstrated that Event-B can facilitate formal development of mode-rich systems and, in particular, proof-based verification of their mode consistency.
