We propose a new aggregation technique based on tensors. This is a double aggregation of tensor descriptors, The first one represents motion by using polynomial coefficients which approximates the optical flow. The other represents the accumulated data of all histograms of gradients of the video. The descriptor is evaluated by a classification of MTH, UCF11 and Hollywood2 datasets, using a SVM classifier. Our method reaches 93.2% of recognition rate with KTH, comparable to the best local approaches. For the UCF11 and Hollywood2 datasets, our recognition achieves fairly competitive results compared to local and learning based approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
