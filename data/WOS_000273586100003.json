We give a condition for the stability of the model, which has an important impact on setting the retrial rate for such systems. We derive the closed form solution in equilibrium for the retrial M/M/1 queue with working vacations, and we also show that the conditional stochastic decomposition holds for this model as well.", "paper_title": "M/M/1 retrial queue with working vacations", "paper_id": "WOS:000273586100003"}
