In a cloud hosting multi-tenant applications, virtual service providers can be provided with real-time recommendation techniques to allocate their virtual resources in edge, core, or access layers in an optimal way to minimize costs and footprint. Such a dynamic technique requires a flexible and optimized networking scheme to enable elastic virtual tenants spanning multiple physical nodes. In this paper, we investigate an environment-aware paradigm for virtual slices that allows improving energy efficiency and dealing with intermittent renewable power sources. A virtual slice consists of optimal flows assigned to virtual machines (VMS) in a virtual data center taking into account traffic requirements, VM locations, physical network capacity, and renewable energy availability. Considering various cloud consolidation schemes, we formulate and then propose an optimal solution for virtual slice assignment problem. Simulations on the GSN showed that the proposed model achieves better performance than the existing methods with respect to network footprint reductions.", "paper_title": "Environment-Aware Virtual Slice Provisioning in Green Cloud Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000356267200015"}
