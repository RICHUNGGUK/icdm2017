We first use several preprocessing steps on the binary image in order to eliminate the spurious lakes and dots, and to reduce the spurious islands, bridges, and spurs in the skeleton image. By removing all the bug pixels introduced at the thinning stage, our algorithm can detect a maximum number of minutiae from the fingerprint skeleton using the Rutovitz Crossing Number. This allows the true minutiae preserved and false minutiae removed in later postprocessing stages. Finally, using the intrinsic duality property of fingerprint image we develop several postprocessing techniques to efficiently remove spurious minutiae. Especially, we define an H-point structure to remove several types of spurious minutiae including bridge, triangle, ladder, and wrinkle all together. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the new algorithms. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
