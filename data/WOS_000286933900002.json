The principle of its operation compared to that of the simple current mirror is discussed. Also are given the comparative simulation results with HSPICE in TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS which verify the theoretical formulation and operation of the proposed structure. Simulation results show an input resistance for the proposed current mirror about 0.006 a\"broken vertical bar. This is 4 x 10(5) times lower than that of the simple one while both working with 1.5 V supply and 50 mu A bias current. It consumes only 161 mu W and exhibits an excellent current error value of Zero at 55 mu A which remains below 0.6% up to 100 mu A. Favorably its minimum output voltage is reduced to 0.2 V.", "paper_title": "Very low input impedance low power current mirror", "paper_id": "WOS:000286933900002"}
