In constrast with standard nonlinear effects, this \"threshold nonlinearity\" is non-perturbative and occurs for infinitesimal perturbations around the lithostatic pressure taken as the reference. For a given earthquake source, such nonlinear elasticity is shown to (i) rotate, widen or narrow the different lobes of stress transfer, (ii) to modify the 1/r(2) 2D-decay of elastic stress Green functions into the generalized power law 1/r(gamma), where gamma depends on the azimuth and on the amplitude of the modulii asymmetry. Using reasonable estimates, this implies an enhancement of the range of interaction between earthquakes by a factor up to 5-10, that is, stress perturbation of 0.1 bar or more are found up to distances of several tens of the rupture length. This may explain certain long-range earthquake triggering and hydrological anomalies in wells and suggest to revisit the standard stress transfer calculations which use linear elasticity. We also show that the standard double-couple of forces representing an earthquake source leads to an opening of the corresponding fault plane, which suggests a mechanism for the non-zero isotropic component of the seismic moment tensor observed for some events.
