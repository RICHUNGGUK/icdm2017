Our proposal consists of multiple burst transmission ( MBT) and virtual resource reservation ( VRR). With MBT, consecutive bursts headed to the same destination are serially transmitted, and, at the transmission of high-priority bursts, the wavelength resource reserved by the head burst is kept reserving for the following bursts. We call it VRR. Computer simulations show that our proposal offers a larger differentiation of burst loss than the conventional offset-based QoS differentiation scheme. Also, it can improve the burst loss rate of both high-priority and low-priority bursts. Moreover, it can minimize the burst loss rate of high-priority bursts even when the high-priority traffic occupies a large percentage of the network traffic. The proposed scheme can be applied to the future multiservice optical network architecture.
