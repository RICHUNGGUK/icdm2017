We first convert the involved Web pages into low resolution images and then use color and coordinate features to represent the image signatures. We use EMD to calculate the signature distances of the images of the Web pages. We train an EMD threshold vector for classifying a Web page as a phishing or a normal one. Large-scale experiments with 10,281 suspected Web pages are carried out to show high classification precision, phishing recall, and applicable time performance for online enterprise solution. We also compare our method with two others to manifest its advantage. We also built up a real system which is already used online and it has caught many real phishing cases.", "paper_title": "Detecting phishing web pages with visual similarity assessment based on Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)", "paper_id": "WOS:000241721300003"}
