The virtual lab, that replicates the existing physical lab, is built using an industrial simulation software package, RobotStudio (TM). The capabilities of this tool are explored in order to complement the introduction of theoretical concepts with practical programming experience. In addition to illustrate the use of different coordinate systems in a robotic cell, a description of the tool center point calibration and examples of evaluating different moving strategies to cover a plane surface, are also presented.", "paper_title": "Experiments with a Virtual Lab for Industrial Robots Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000366995500002"}
