Yet there is likely to be a misconception that users with the same disability category share the same user interface needs; furthermore, the majority of the literature has been oriented toward total blindness rather than low vision, possibly leading to dissatisfaction with assistive technologies and discontinuation of its use by those with low vision. The aim of this article is to advance the understanding of the needs of those with low vision especially in relation to haptic-incorporated multimodal user interfaces. A scenario-based, participatory design approach was used to explore their needs. A total of 19 user needs were systematically documented under three categories: audition (n=5), touch (n=11), and vision (n=3). This article focuses on qualitatively exploring their needs and theoretically interpreting the needs in the light of previous studies.", "paper_title": "Elicitation of Haptic User Interface Needs of People with Low Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000320077000004"}
