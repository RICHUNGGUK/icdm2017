To this end, a real-time image transfer algorithm is developed to stylize the cloned object according to a distance metric based on the artistic styles and semantic information. Several interactive functions, such as layering, shadowing, semantic labeling, and direction field editing, are provided to enhance the harmonization of the composite image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Parallel Style-Aware Image Cloning for Artworks", "paper_id": "WOS:000347306600006"}
