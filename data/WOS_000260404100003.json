The difficulty of learning to build the individual diagrams in the UML, however has received scant attention. In this article, we consider the case of the UML sequence diagram. Despite the fact that these diagrams are among the most frequently used in practice, they are difficult to learn to build. In this article, we consider the question of why these diagrams remain so difficult to learn to build. Specifically, we analyze the process of learning to build sequence diagrams in the context of cognitive complexity theory. Based on this anal is, and drawing on the theory of learner-centered design, we develop a set of recommendations for presenting the sequence diagram building task to the student analyst to reduce the complexity of learning how to build them.", "paper_title": "Applying Learner-Centered Design Principles to UML Sequence Diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000260404100003"}
