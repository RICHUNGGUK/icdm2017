The controller does not use the information regarding the differential equations that govern the plant's behavior or any of their bounds. The algorithm presented is able to determine the most-adequate topology for the fuzzy controller based on the data obtained during the system's normal operation. Therefore, the controller can start operating with an empty set of fuzzy rules and needs no offline training. The proposed methodology comprises two phases: adaptation of the consequents for every selected topology and online addition of new membership functions (MFs). Some of the main advantages of this method are its robustness under changes on the plant's dynamics, good performance in noisy situations, and the ability to perform variable selection among a group of candidate variables. Unlike other online methods, the modification of the topology is based on the analysis of the whole operating region of the plant, thus providing higher robustness. Several simulation examples are used to show these features.", "paper_title": "A New Methodology for the Online Adaptation of Fuzzy Self-Structuring Controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317000004"}
