The detection process operates through two techniques called backward and forward ACOSD (B-ACOSD and F-ACOSD, respectively), which work in parallel to increase the detection accuracy and reduce the false alarm rate. Two architectures were considered for the proposed detector. The B-ACOSD algorithm operates the censoring beginning from the last cell belonging to a window of N range cells, whereas the F-ACOSD algorithm considers the censoring based on a scan beginning with the first cell in the same sorted window of cells. The detector is implemented on a FPGA-Altera Stratix II as a system-on-chip that integrates a Nios II core processor with our proposed detector as a co-processor and additional embedded memories and interfaces using parallelism and pipelining. For a reference window of 16 cells, the processor works properly with a processing speed of up to 129.13 MHz and a processing time of only 0.23 mu s, within the range of the maximum tolerated delay of 0.5 mu s fixed by the pulse width [A.
