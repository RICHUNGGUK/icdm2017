In this paper, a kind of genetic algorithm based on sectional code for minimizing the total cost of assignment of due date, earliness and tardiness in this kind of scheduling problem is proposed to determine the optimal common due date and the optimal scheduling policy for determining the job number and their processing order on each machine. Also, Simulated annealing mechanism and the iterative heuristic fine-tuning operator are introduced into the genetic algorithm so as to construct three kinds of hybrid genetic algorithms with good performance. Numerical computational results focusing on the identical parallel machine scheduling problem and the general parallel machine scheduling problem shows that these algorithms Outperform heuristic procedures, and fit for larger scale parallel machine earliness/tardiness scheduling problem. Moreover, with practical application data from one of the largest cotton colored weaving enterprises in China, numerical computational results show that these genetic algorithms are effective and robust, and that especially the performance of the hybrid genetic algorithm based on simulated annealing and the iterative heuristic fine-tuning operator is the best among them.
