In particular, let us mention here the rough granular computing approach based on the rough set approach and its combination with other approaches to soft computing. However, the issues related to interactions of infogranules with the physical world and to perception of interactions in the physical world by infogranules are not well elaborated yet. On the other hand the understanding of interactions is the critical issue of complex systems. We propose to model complex systems by interactive computational systems (ICS) created by societies of agents. Computations in ICS are based on complex granules (c-granules, for short). In the paper we concentrate on some basic issues related to interactive computations based on c-granules performed by agents in the physical world.", "paper_title": "Interactive Complex Granules", "paper_id": "WOS:000343008800007"}
