Spread transform (ST) scheme is implemented using the transform coefficients of both the host and the watermark signal. Watermark embedding strength is adaptively adjusted using frequency sensitivity, luminance, contrast and entropy masking of HVS model. The choice of Hadamard transform as watermark embedding domain offers several advantages, such as low loss in image information (higher image fidelity), greater reliability of watermark detection and higher data hiding capacity at high degree of compression. Performance of the proposed method is compared with a number of recently reported watermarking schemes based on spread spectrum (SS) and quantization index modulation (QIM). (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
