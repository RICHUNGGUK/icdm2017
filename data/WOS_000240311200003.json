While algorithms exist for producing k-anonymous data, the model has been that of a single source wanting to publish data. Due to privacy issues, it is common that data from different sites cannot be shared directly. Therefore, this paper presents a two-party framework along with an application that generates k-anonymous data from two vertically partitioned sources without disclosing data from one site to the other. The framework is privacy preserving in the sense that it satisfies the secure definition commonly defined in the literature of Secure Multiparty Computation.", "paper_title": "A secure distributed framework for achieving k-anonymity", "paper_id": "WOS:000240311200003"}
