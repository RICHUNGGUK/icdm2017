However, it is more popular in real-world applications that an example is associated with multiple labels simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based learning framework in the setting of semi-supervised learning with multiple labels. This framework is characterized by simultaneously exploiting the inherent correlations among multiple labels and the label consistency over the graph. Based on the proposed framework, we further develop two novel graph-based algorithms. We apply the proposed methods to video concept detection over TRECVID 2006 corpus and report superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art graph-based approaches and the representative semi-supervised multi-label learning methods.
