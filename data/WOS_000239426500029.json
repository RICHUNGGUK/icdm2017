In the second order DHT of a binary generalized Gordon-Mills-Welch (GMW) sequence, we show that there exist realizations which can be theoretically determined by the second order DHT in its subfield. Furthermore, we show that complete realizations of any binary two-level autocorrelation sequence with respect to a quadratic residue (QR) sequence by the second order DHT are theoretically determined.", "paper_title": "Realizations from decimation Hadamard transform for special classes of binary sequences with two-level autocorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239426500029"}
