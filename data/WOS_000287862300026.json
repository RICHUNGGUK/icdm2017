Past comparisons of such surfaces involve either volume deformations or non-rigid matching under fixed parameterizations of surfaces. We propose a new mathematical representation of surfaces, called-maps, such that L(2) distances between such maps are invariant to re-parameterizations. This property allows for removing the parameterization variability by optimizing over the re-parameterization group, resulting in a proper parameterization-invariant distance between shapes of surfaces. We demonstrate this method in shape analysis of multiple brain structures, for 34 subjects in the Detroit Fetal Alcohol and Drug Exposure Cohort study, which results in a 91% classification rate for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder cases and controls. This method outperforms some existing techniques such as spherical harmonic point distribution model (SPHARM-PDM) or iterative closest point (ICP).", "paper_title": "Parameterization-Invariant Shape Comparisons of Anatomical Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000287862300026"}
