The concurrent optimization model is applied to design the topologies of light weight structures and of the material microstructure. The multi-objective optimization formulation attempts to find minimum structural compliance under only mechanical loads and minimum thermal expansion of the surfaces we are interested in under only thermo loads. The proposed optimization model is applied to a sandwich elliptically curved shell structure, an axisymmetric structure and a 3D structure. The advantage of the concurrent optimization model to single scale topology optimization model in improving the multi-objective performances of the thermoelastic structures is investigated. The influences of available material volume fraction and weighting coefficients are also discussed. Numerical examples demonstrate that the porous material is conducive to enhance the multi-objective performance of the thermoelastic structures in some cases, especially when lightweight structure is emphasized. An \"optimal\" material volume fraction is observed in some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective concurrent topology optimization of thermoelastic structures composed of homogeneous porous material", "paper_id": "WOS:000316638300008"}
