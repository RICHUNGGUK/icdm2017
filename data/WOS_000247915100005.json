We exploit an asymmetry in its output function to show that the internal state can be recovered after having 2(w) outputs, using 2(1.5w) operations. For w = 32 the attack is practical, but for their recommended w = 64 it is only of theoretical interest.", "paper_title": "Theoretical cryptanalysis of the Klimov-Shamir number generator TF-1", "paper_id": "WOS:000247915100005"}
