The proposed trigonometric layerwise shear deformation theory accounts for: (a) non-linear and constant variation of in-plane and transverse displacement respectively through the panel thickness; (b) adequate transverse shear deformation and satisfy transverse shear traction free conditions on the top and the bottom surfaces of the plate. The accuracy of the present code is ascertained by comparing it with the exact solution and various available results in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
