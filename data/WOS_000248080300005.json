From the objective and subjective data provided by the own portal and by it users, two different and complementary kinds of analysis (functional and users') are performed. Assessment of various capabilities, among which visibility and usability stand out, is provided. The highly positive but improvable results offer a detailed analysis of the functional aspects of the portal itself and of the users' relations with this information resource. From these analyses strengths and weaknesses are extracted and some proposals for improvement are derived.", "paper_title": "An educational resource for information literacy in higher education: Functional and users analyses of the e-COMs academic portal", "paper_id": "WOS:000248080300005"}
