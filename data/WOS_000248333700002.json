This paper examines the practical issues surrounding trade-offers and manufacturing strategy, and offers a framework for better management of trade-offers. The analysis indicates that current views on trade-offers are either impractical or static. The authors propose a consolidated approach in which the focus of strategic improvement process is divided into short-term and long-term strategies. It is suggested that in the short term, strategic initiatives must focus on overcoming ' perceived' trade-offers and system constraints in order to achieve the firm's Manufacturing Performance Potential. In the long term, they must focus on eliminating the 'real' trade-offers and technical constraints of the system in order to achieve world-class levels of performance. While the current approaches to trade-offer improvement focus on compromises and/ or application of current 'best practices', manufacturing system and process innovation are proposed as the key to the elimination of trade-offers. Two problem-solving methodologies, Theory of Constraints and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, were found to provide useful tools necessary for system and process innovation. With the aid of a case study, we demonstrate how these methodologies can be used to eliminate manufacturing trade-offers, in order to improve a company's competitiveness.", "paper_title": "Strategic manufacturing system and process innovation through elimination of trade-offs", "paper_id": "WOS:000248333700002"}
