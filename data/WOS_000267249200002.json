Pressure data measured at all locations around the section at earlier instants of time were needed to yield accurate temporal predictions of the lower order statistics of pressure, lift and drag. However, using data from only a few adjacent pressure taps at earlier times was not sufficient since pressure in incompressible turbulent flows depends on velocity fluctuations over the entire flow domain.
