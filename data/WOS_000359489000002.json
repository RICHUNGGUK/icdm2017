In this paper, we first propose two polynomial time approximation schemes (PTASs) for the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem and the Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC) problem in growth-bounded graphs. We then propose an approximation algorithm, with a performance guarantee of (1 + 2 epsilon/(1 - epsilon)) for sufficiently small epsilon>0, for the Minimum Connected Vertex Cover (MCVC) problem. In contrast to previously proposed schemes for VC problems, our approach does not assume geometric representation of vertices in growth-bounded graphs. We also prove that the running times of the proposed algorithms are bounded by a polynomial in terms of the graph size and the input e. We evaluate the performance of our algorithms through simulation.", "paper_title": "Approximate Algorithms for Vertex Cover Problems in WSN Topology Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000359489000002"}
