However, it suffers from the computational burden arising from a multidimensional integral. In this paper, efficient bounding techniques for space-time codes are developed in the framework of Gallager bounds. Two closed-form upper bounds, the ellipsoidal bound and the spherical bound, are proposed that come close to simulation results within a few tenths of a decibel. In addition, two novel methods of weight enumeration operating on a further reduced state diagram are presented, which, in conjunction with the bounding techniques, give a thorough treatment of performance bounds for space-time codes.", "paper_title": "Performance of space-time codes: Gallager bounds and weight enumeration", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400015"}
