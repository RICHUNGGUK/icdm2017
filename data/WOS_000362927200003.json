By drawing upon the theories of Reciprocity and Network Effects, we propose that OSS projects for techies-only are more likely to exhibit characteristics that are explained by balanced reciprocity, whereas OSS projects for the general population are more likely to show characteristics that are rooted in generalized reciprocity. In addition, we propose that local network effects can be used to explain certain characteristics of OSS projects for techies-only, whereas direct and indirect network effects shape the corresponding characteristics of OSS projects for the general population differently. The findings support our hypotheses and lead us to recommend actions for OSS projects targeted towards the general population, as well as suggestions for future research.", "paper_title": "CHARACTERISTICS OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROJECTS FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION: RECIPROCITY AND NETWORK EFFECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000362927200003"}
