Setting F to be (deg(u) + deg(v))d(u, v), deg(u)deg(v)d(u, v), (deg(u) + deg(v))d(u,v)(-1), and deg(u)deg(v)d(u, v)(-1), we get the degree distance index DD, the Gutman index Gut, the additively weighted Harary index H-A, and the multiplicatively weighted Harary index H-M, respectively. Let g(n,m) be the set of connected graphs of order n and size m. It is proved that if G is an element of g(n,m) where 4 <= n <= m <= 2n - 4, then H-A(G) <= (m(m + 5) + 2(n - 1)(n - 3))/2 and DD (G) >= (4m -n)(n -1) - (m-n+1)(m -n+ 6). The extremal graphs are characterized in both cases and are the same. Similarly, the graphs from g(n,m) with m = n + (k 2) - k, 2 <= k <= n - 1, maximizing the multiplicatively weighted Harary index and minimizing the Gutman index are obtained.", "paper_title": "Extremal (n, m)-Graphs with Respect to Distance-Degree-Based Topological Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000346106900023"}
