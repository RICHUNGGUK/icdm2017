In this paper, we introduce a generalization of quasi-MV algebras, called square root quasi-pseudo-MV algebras ( algebras, for short). First, we investigate the related properties of algebras and characterize two special types: Cartesian and flat algebras. Second, we present two representations of algebras. Furthermore, we generalize the concepts of PR-groups to non-commutative case and prove that the interval of a non-commutative PR-group with strong order unit is a Cartesian algebra. Finally, we introduce non-commutative PR-groupoids which extend abelian PR-groupoids and show that the category of negation groupoids with operators and the category of non-commutative PR-groupoids are equivalent.", "paper_title": "The representation of square root quasi-pseudo-MV algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000347836800002"}
