Then a single-server queueing system with regenerative input flow and an unreliable server are considered. By applying coupling we establish the ergodicity condition and prove the limit theorem in the heavy traffic situation (traffic coefficient rho < 1, rho up arrow 1). The asymptotic analysis of the super-heavy traffic situation (rho >= 1) is also realized.", "paper_title": "Coupling method for asymptotic analysis of queues with regenerative input and unreliable server", "paper_id": "WOS:000330767300003"}
