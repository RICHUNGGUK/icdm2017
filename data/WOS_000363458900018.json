We highlight four distinct definitions of a systems of linear equations where coefficients are replaced by intervals, each of which based on a generalizationof scalar equality to intervals. Each of the four extensions of interval linear systems has a corresponding solution set whose calculation can be carried out by a general unified method based on a relatively new concept of constraint intervals. We also consider the smallest multidimensional intervals containing the solution sets. We propose several extensions of the interval setting to systems of linear equations where coefficients are fuzzy intervals. This unified setting clarifies many of the anomalous or inconsistent published results in various fuzzy interval linear systems studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
