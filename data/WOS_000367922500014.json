While benefitting from all the advantages of the cloud computing paradigm, they are also suffering from one of its main drawbacks-privacy issues. As intrusion detection system security policies expose critical information regarding the organization such as vulnerabilities, sharing this information with cloud service providers raises serious privacy concerns. The following paper proposes and presents three novel solutions as a first step towards preserving the privacy of cloud-based intrusion detection system security policies. All the solutions utilize hybrid cloud architecture, as this is a leading trend in the cloud-based intrusion detection systems market, and share the concept of performing the most computationally expensive operations, which are pattern-matching operations, in the public cloud. By taking the final decision regarding network packets in the private cloud on customer premises, the desired level of privacy is provided. Experimental results, received as an output from the performed simulations, confirm that all the presented solutions are efficient enough for the deployment of cloud-based intrusion detection systems.
