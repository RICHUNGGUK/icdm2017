The proposed model uses continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) to model the failure-repair behavior of a grid resource. In grid computing environment, a resource not only may fail during task execution, but also it can cancel its membership at any time. Hence, the proposed CTMC considers the availability of a grid resource to a grid user in both failure and membership refusal situations. After modeling the availability of the resource, the mean sojourn time of grid tasks in each of the availability states is estimated. Assigning the mean sojourn times of the tasks as performance levels to each of the CTMC's states, a Markov reward model (MRM) representing the combined performance and availability measures is obtained. Computing the cumulative state probability of the CTMC and multiplying reward rates of the MRM's states to each of the corresponding state probabilities, the expected accumulated sojourn time of grid tasks in each of the grid resources is achieved. An illustrative example is presented and the results obtained from the proposed model are reported in cases where various scheduling disciplines are considered inside the grid resource to simultaneously service grid and local tasks.", "paper_title": "Combined performance and availability analysis of distributed resources in grid computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826700017"}
