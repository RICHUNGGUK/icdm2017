Many researchers have proposed methods to directly hide secret data in an image. However, images are usually compressed and stored using compression techniques in indices format. Hence, this paper proposes a novel and reversible data hiding method for vector quantization (VQ) compressed images. The proposed scheme exploits characteristics of VQ indices and the prediction errors between them to embed the secret data and to guarantee that the original indices can be recovered to reconstruct the VQ compressed image. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve higher embedding capacity and better bit rate compared to other schemes.", "paper_title": "REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING FOR VQ INDICES USING PREDICTION ERRORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600028"}
