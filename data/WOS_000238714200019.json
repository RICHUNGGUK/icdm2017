In this paper, we take a different approach, inspired by the excellent work of Caselles et al. We view the inpainting problem as a particular case of image interpolation in which we intend to propagate level lines. Expressing this in terms of local neighborhoods and using a Taylor expansion we derive a third-order PDE that performs inpainting. This PDE is optimal in the sense that it is the most accurate third-order PDE which can ensure continuation of level lines. The continuation is strong, allowing the restoration of thin structures occluded by a wide gap. The result is also contrast invariant. This is a novel PDE, which, in both its accuracy and contrast invariance, outperforms the approaches cited above.", "paper_title": "Strong-continuation, contrast-invariant inpainting with a third-order optimal PDE", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714200019"}
