We present the generalized probabilistic OWA (GPOWA) operator. It is a new aggregation operator that unifies the probability with the OWA operator considering the degree of importance that each concept has in the analysis. It includes a wide range of particular cases including the GOWA operator and the probabilistic OWA (POWA) operator. We also study the applicability of this new approach and we see that it is very broad because all the previous studies that use the probability or the OWA operator can be revised with this new approach. We develop an application in multi-person decision making concerning the selection of the optimal strategies.", "paper_title": "GROUP DECISION-MAKING WITH GENERALIZED AND PROBABILISTIC AGGREGATION OPERATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679500025"}
