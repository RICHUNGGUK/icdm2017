However, accurately and efficiently inferring diseases is non-trivial, especially for community-based health services due to the vocabulary gap, incomplete information, correlated medical concepts, and limited high quality training samples. In this paper, we first report a user study on the information needs of health seekers in terms of questions and then select those that ask for possible diseases of their manifested symptoms for further analytic. We next propose a novel deep learning scheme to infer the possible diseases given the questions of health seekers. The proposed scheme is comprised of two key components. The first globally mines the discriminant medical signatures from raw features. The second deems the raw features and their signatures as input nodes in one layer and hidden nodes in the subsequent layer, respectively. Meanwhile, it learns the inter-relations between these two layers via pre-training with pseudo-labeled data. Following that, the hidden nodes serve as raw features for the more abstract signature mining. With incremental and alternative repeating of these two components, our scheme builds a sparsely connected deep architecture with three hidden layers. Overall, it well fits specific tasks with fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset labeled by online doctors show the significant performance gains of our scheme.", "paper_title": "Disease Inference from Health-Related Questions via Sparse Deep Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000357692600008"}
