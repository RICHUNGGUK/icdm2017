Accurate detection of SAPs is an important issue in proteomic analysis at the experimental and bioinformatic level. Herein, we present sapFinder, an R software package, for detection of the variant peptides based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based proteomics data. This package automates the construction of variation-associated databases from public SNV repositories or sample-specific next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and the identification of SAPs through database searching, post-processing and generation of HTML-based report with visualized interface.", "paper_title": "sapFinder: an R/Bioconductor package for detection of variant peptides in shotgun proteomics experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000344644600025"}
