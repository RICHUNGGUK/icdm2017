In this paper, we present a novel multi-scale VBM using the weighted spherical harmonic (SPHARM) representation to address the issue. The weighted-SPHARM provides the explicit smooth functional representation of a true unknown cortical boundary. Based on this new representation, the gray matter tissue density is constructed using the Euclidean distance map from a voxel to the estimated smooth cortical boundary. The methodology is applied in localizing abnormal cortical regions in a group of autistic subjects.", "paper_title": "Multi-scale voxel-based morphometry via weighted spherical harmonic representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500005"}
