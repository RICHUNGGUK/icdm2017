IMED uses the prior knowledge that pixels located near one another have little variance in gray scale values, and defines a metric matrix according to the spatial distance between pixels. In this paper, we propose an adaptive image Euclidean distance (AIMED), which considers not only the prior spatial knowledge, but also the prior gray level knowledge from images. The most important advantage of the proposed AIMED over IMED is that AIMED makes the metric matrix adaptive to the content of the concerned images. Two ways of using gray level information are proposed. One is based on gray level distances, and the other is based on cosine dissimilarity of gray levels. Experiments on two facial databases and a handwritten digital database show that AIMED achieves the highest classification accuracy when it is embedded in nearest neighbor classifiers, principal component analysis, and support vector machines.
