The procedure consists of only one matrix factorization for the whole design process and a small number of iterative corrections for each design cycle. The approach is tested on 3D topology optimization problems. It is shown that the computational cost can be reduced by one order of magnitude without affecting the outcome of the optimization process.", "paper_title": "On reducing computational effort in topology optimization: how far can we go?", "paper_id": "WOS:000291254600003"}
