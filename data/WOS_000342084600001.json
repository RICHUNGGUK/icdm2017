As a first step in recommending exhibits where a visitor may wish to spend some time, this article investigates predictive user models for personalised prediction of museum visitors' viewing times at exhibits. We consider two content-based models and a nearest-neighbour collaborative filter, and develop a collaborative model based on the theory of spatial processes which relies on a notion of distance between exhibits. We discuss models of exhibit distance derived from viewing-time similarity, semantic similarity and walking distance. The results from our evaluation with a real-world dataset of visitor pathways collected at Melbourne Museum (Melbourne, Australia) suggest that utilising walking and semantic distances between exhibits enables more accurate predictions of a visitor's viewing times of unseen exhibits than using distances derived from observed exhibit viewing times. Our results also show that all models outperform a non-personalised baseline, that content-based viewing time prediction yields better results than nearest-neighbour collaborative prediction, and that our collaborative model based on spatial processes attains the highest predictive accuracy overall.", "paper_title": "Personalised viewing-time prediction in museums", "paper_id": "WOS:000342084600001"}
