Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an intraclass correlation (ICC) between homepage web accessibility barrier (WAB) scores and the WAB scores of web site levels I through 3 for 33 popular web sites. Findings - The paper finds that the homepage is not sufficient to detect the accessibility of the web site. ICC of the homepage and average of levels 1-3 is 0.250 (p = 0.062) and ICC of levels 1, 2, and 3 is 0.784 (p < 0.0001). Evaluating the homepage and first-level pages gives more accurate results of entire site accessibility. Originality/value - This is first study correlating homepage accessibility with web site accessibility.", "paper_title": "Homepage not enough when evaluating web site accessibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000264045400006"}
