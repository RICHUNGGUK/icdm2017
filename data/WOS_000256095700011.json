The appropriate testing of a single IP-block may require the conversion of the overall encoder from software to hardware, which is dificult to complete in the short time required by the competition-driven reduced time-to-market demanded for the adoption of a new video coding standard. This paper presents a new design flow to accelerate the conformance testing of an IP-block using the H. 264/AVC software reference model. An example block of the simplified 8 x 8 transformation and quantization, which is adopted in FRExt, is provided as a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "A simplified 8 x 8 transformation and quantization real-time IP-block for mpeg-4 H.264/AVC applications: A new design flow approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000256095700011"}
