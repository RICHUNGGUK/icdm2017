It is also an increasingly popular research topic in several academic fields. Strategic decision support that is now available for BR is surveyed and assessed. Then a dominance-based rough-set approach is developed and used to classify cities facing BR issues according to the level of two characteristics, BR effectiveness and BR future needs. The data for the classification are based on the widely available results of a survey of US cities. The unique features of the method are its reduced requirement for preference information, its ability to handle missing information effectively, and the easily understood linguistic decision rules that it generates, based on a training classification provided by experts. The resulting classification should be a valuable aid to cities and governments as they plan their BR projects and budgets. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
