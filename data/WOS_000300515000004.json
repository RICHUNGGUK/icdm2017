Strong business competition for subscribers, along with the ever increasing availability of wireless networks will give nomadic and mobile users the opportunity, and systems the power, to make better handover decisions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the literature on mobility management architectures for seamless handover of mobile users in heterogeneous networks. We describe the design rationale for selected architectures, with an in-depth analysis of their main goals, assumptions, and requirements. We also provide directions for further work in this field by highlighting the mandatory requirements and the features of future architectures. We then present a new architecture called Context-Aware Mobility Management System (CAMMS). CAMMS is a new cross-layer, context-aware and interactive approach to seamless handover of users and services. With that proposal, we identified the essential functional entities that must be part of future architectures.", "paper_title": "Vertical Mobility Management Architectures in Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000300515000004"}
