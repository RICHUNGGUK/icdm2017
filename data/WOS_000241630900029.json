This paper deals with the complexity analysis of that access control, and finds it to be, in its worst cases, PSPACE-complete, but polynomial time for practical cases. The PSPACE-hardness reduction uses the theory of succinct problems in a more general manner than circuit representation.", "paper_title": "The complexity of discretionary access control", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630900029"}
