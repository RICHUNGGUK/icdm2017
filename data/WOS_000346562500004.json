However, because of the so-called miss-matched conditions across enrollment and probe samples and identity-dependent factors these scores typically exhibit statistical variations that affect the verification performance of biometric systems. To mitigate these variations, score-normalisation techniques, such as the z-norm, the t-norm or the zt-norm, are commonly adopted. In this study, the authors study the problem of score normalisation in the scope of biometric verification and introduce a new class of non-parametric normalisation techniques, which make no assumptions regarding the shape of the distribution from which the scores are drawn (as the parametric techniques do). Instead, they estimate the shape of the score distribution and use the estimate to map the initial distribution to a common (predefined) distribution. Based on the new class of normalisation techniques they also develop a hybrid normalisation scheme that combines non-parametric and parametric techniques into hybrid two-step procedures. They evaluate the performance of the non-parametric and hybrid techniques in face-verification experiments on the FRGCv2 and SCFace databases and show that the non-parametric techniques outperform their parametric counterparts and that the hybrid procedure is not only feasible, but also retains some desirable characteristics from both the non-parametric and the parametric techniques.", "paper_title": "Beyond parametric score normalisation in biometric verification systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000346562500004"}
