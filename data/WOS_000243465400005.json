In this paper we extend this result to the continuous case. First we derive necessary equations for the solution of both BV-regularization and the taut string algorithm by computing suitable Gateaux derivatives. The equivalence then follows from a uniqueness result.", "paper_title": "The equivalence of the taut string algorithm and BV-regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000243465400005"}
