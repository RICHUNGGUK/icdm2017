We propose a monotonic concentration-response model that maps conventional sensor-array inputs into a distributed activation pattern across a large population of neuroreceptors. Projection onto glomerular units in the olfactory bulb is then simulated with a self-organizing model of chemotopic convergence. The pattern recognition performance of the model is characterized using a database of odor patterns from an array of temperature modulated chemical sensors. The chemotopic code achieved by the proposed model is shown to improve the signal-to-noise ratio available at the sensor inputs while being consistent with results from neurobiology.", "paper_title": "Processing of chemical sensor arrays with a biologically inspired model of olfactory coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000238865200015"}
