The theory is located at a level of abstraction substantively above that of neural substrate; it models function and not detailed mechanism and works over symbolic representations of percepts. I support the proposal with evidence from a range of computational work concerning learning of and generation from statistical models and argue that the perceptual grounding of the mechanisms presented here may be generalised away, to account, ultimately, for original thought itself.", "paper_title": "The Mind's Chorus: Creativity Before Consciousness", "paper_id": "WOS:000308817500009"}
