Although metric indexing approaches are able to speed up query processing by two orders of magnitude, their applicability to large-scale multimedia databases containing billions of images is still a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a parallel approach that balances the utilization of CPU and many-core GPUs for efficient similarity search with the Signature Quadratic Form Distance. In particular, we show how to process multiple distance computations and other parts of the search procedure in parallel, achieving maximal performance of the combined CPU/GPU system. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach implemented on a common workstation with 2 GPU cards outperforms traditional parallel implementation on a high-end 48-core NUMA server in terms of efficiency almost by an order of magnitude. If we consider also the price of the high-end server that is ten times higher than that of the GPU workstation then, based on price/performance ratio, the GPU-based similarity search beats the CPU-based solution by almost two orders of magnitude. Although proposed for the SQFD, our approach of fast GPU-based similarity search is applicable for any distance function that is efficiently parallelizable in the SIMT execution model.", "paper_title": "Combining CPU and GPU architectures for fast similarity search", "paper_id": "WOS:000305520200002"}
