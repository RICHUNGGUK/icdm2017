The fuzzy particle swarm optimization vector quantization (FPSOVQ) learning schemes, combined advantages of the adaptive fuzzy inference method (FIM), the simple VQ concept and the efficient particle swarm optimization (PSO), are considered at the same time to automatically create near optimum codebook to achieve the application of image compression. The FIM is known as a soft decision to measure the relational grade for a given sequence. In our research, the FIM is applied to determine the similar grade between the codebook and the original image patterns. In spite of popular usage of Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) algorithm, the powerful evolutional PSO learning algorithm is taken to optimize the fuzzy inference system, which is used to extract appropriate codebooks for compressing several input testing grey-level images. The proposed FPSOVQ learning scheme compared with LBG based VQ learning method is presented to demonstrate its great result in several real image compression examples. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
