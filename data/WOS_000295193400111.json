Monitoring equipment was used to collect information about the lime production process. From this data a dynamic simulated mathematic model of lime production was obtained. The model is based on the equations of mass balance, constitutive balance, reaction dynamics and energy. This model allowed the concept of holographic monitoring to be developed. From the analysis of the production process, direct experience of operating the plant, and a number of parameters obtained from real-time detection and off-line numerical simulation results of the furnace process, a real-time diagnostic expert system for the lime shaft furnace was constructed. The benefits of using the system are that equipment failures are greatly reduced, the output of the lime shaft kiln is increased by about 25%, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the exhaust is increased by about 10%, the decomposition rate of limestone is increased by 6%, and the coke ratio decreased by 20%.
