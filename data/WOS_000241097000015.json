We use information exchange in a supply chain as a representation of inter organizational information sharing, and study five strategies for information sharing that range from minimal to near-complete information exchange. We present analytical evaluation of the relative performance of these strategies and experimental results from a proof-of-concept system. Our results show that near-complete information sharing that combines more than one type of information being shared has better performance in volatile market conditions.
