Four prevalent denormalization strategies have been identified and examined under various scenarios to illustrate the conditions where they are most effective. The relational algebra, query trees, and join cost function are used to examine the effect on the performance of relational systems. The guidelines and analysis provided are sufficiently general and they can be applicable to a variety of databases, in particular to data warehouse implementations, for decision support systems.
