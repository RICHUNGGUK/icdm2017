However, unlike desktops and notebook computers, a 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) is often adopted as the only security mechanism for mobile devices. Because of their limited length, PINs are vulnerable to shoulder surfing and systematic trial-and-error attacks. This paper reports the effectiveness of user authentication using keystroke dynamics-based authentication (KDA) on mobile devices. We found that a KDA system can be effective for mobile devices in terms of authentication accuracy. Use of artificial rhythms leads to even better authentication performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
