It adopts a holistic view, meaning that apart from a sum of its constituents, the definition of a system should also include the interaction of its elements. SC implies an unconventional massively parallel computer architecture. However, existing software implementations have been limited in terms of performance, flexibility and programmability. This paper extends previous work which introduced the first hardware systemic computation implementation using FPGAs. We present various software enhancements, resulting in a complete and efficient SC programming platform. An SC application modelling the effect of genetic abnormalities and therapeutic approaches on tumour development is demonstrated, confirming that the suggested general-purpose platform performance, flexibility and programmability advantages over a dedicated software model.", "paper_title": "Demonstrating the performance, flexibility and programmability of the hardware architecture of systemic computation modelling cancer growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000368397200002"}
