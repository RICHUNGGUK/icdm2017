The proposed VSS scheme can encrypt more number of secret images compared with the normal VSS schemes. Furthermore, the proposed technique can be applied to the VSS scheme that allows to turn over some shares in decryption. From the theoretical point of view, it is interesting to note that such VSS schemes cannot be obtained from so-called basis matrices straightforwardly.", "paper_title": "Visual secret sharing schemes for multiple secret images allowing the rotation of shares", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827500030"}
