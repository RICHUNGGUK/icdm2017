We show that the geometrical structures of silicon nanotubes can be stabilized by doping metal (K, Ca, Y and Lu). Electronic structure calculations show that Y and Lu atoms gain extra charge from Si atoms, the bonding between Si and the MnSi8(n+1) (M = K, Ca) is of a mixed metallic-covalent nature, and the magnetic moment of K14Si120 quenches completely compared with K7Si64. Some properties are discussed to provide guidance to experimental efforts for nanomagnetic materials and spintronics. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
