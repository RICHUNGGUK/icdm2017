Local processing at measurement point is discouraged as it would considerably affect major functionality of a network device. When traffic is analyzed at flow level, the notion of flow timeout generates differences in flow lifespan and impedes unbiased monitoring, where only n-top flows ordered by a certain metric are considered. This paper proposes an alternative manner of traffic analysis based on source IP aggregation. The method uses flows as basic building blocks but ignores timeouts, using short monitoring intervals instead. Multidimensional space of metrics obtained through IP aggregation, however, enhances capabilities of traffic analysis by facilitating detection of various anomalous conditions in traffic simultaneously.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Detection of Traffic Anomalies Based on IP Aggregation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263079200003"}
