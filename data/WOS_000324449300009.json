Design/methodology/approach - The paper considers this question: is this possible to find some first and second effects about CSER in 24 sectors of Catalonian economy? Findings - The analytical model is used in order to develop a conceptual model to explain the forgotten effects or CSER in Catalonia, Spain. Originality/value - This paper applies the theory of the forgotten effects with the analysis of the causes or external elements to the Catalonian economy and of the effects or reflections that it produces in the sustainability.", "paper_title": "Forgotten effects of corporate social and environmental responsibility A case study of Catalonian economy", "paper_id": "WOS:000324449300009"}
