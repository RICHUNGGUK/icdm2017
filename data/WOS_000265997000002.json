The flow under consideration is governed by Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluids and modeled with the finite volume method. Large eddy simulation is used to simulate the unsteady turbulent flow. The structure is representedby a finite element formulation. The present work introduces a strongly coupled partitioned approach that is applied to complex flow in fluid machinery. In this approach, the fluid and structure equations are solved separately using different solvers, but are implicitly coupled into one single module based on sensitivity analysis of the important displacement and stress modes. The applied modes and their responses are used to build up a reduced-order model. The proposed model is used to predict the unsteady flow fields of a 3D complete passage, involving in stay, guide vanes, and runner blades, for a Francis hydro turbine and FSI is considererd. The computational results show that a fairly good convergence solution is achieved by using the reduced-order model that is based on only a few displacement and stress modes, which largely reduces the computational cost, compared with traditional approaches. At the same time, a comparison of the numerical results of the model with available experimental data validates the methodology and assesses its accuracy.
