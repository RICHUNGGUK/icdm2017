The evolution and convergence properties of hybrid methods based on both sparsity and smoothness constraints for the resulting nonnegative matrix factors are discussed. The interpretability of NMF outputs in specific contexts are provided along with opportunities for future work in the modification of NMF algorithms for large-scale and time-varying data sets.
