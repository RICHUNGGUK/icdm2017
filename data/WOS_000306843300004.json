Used natively or as back-engines, they are accumulating a record of success stories and, as witnessed by the annual SMT competition, their performances and capacity are also increasing steadily. Introduced in previous contributions of ours, a new application domain providing an outstanding challenge for SMT solvers is represented by verification of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) a widely-adopted kind of artificial neural network. In this paper we present an extensive evaluation of the current state-of-the-art SMT solvers and assess their potential in the promising domain of MLP verification.", "paper_title": "Challenging SMT solvers to verify neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306843300004"}
