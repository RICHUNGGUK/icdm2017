In traditional point-to-point wireless communication, significant efforts had been made by the existing studies on enhancing the utilization of the channel access time. However, in the emerging wireless network using MU-MIMO, considering only the time domain in channel utilization is not sufficient. As multiple transmitters are allowed to transmit packets simultaneously to the same AP, allowing more antennas at AP would lead to higher channel utilization. Thus, the channel utilization in MU-MIMO should consider both time and spatial domains, i.e., the channel access time and the antenna usage, which have not been considered in the existing methods. In this paper, we point out that the fundamental problem is lacking of the antenna information of contention nodes in channel contention. To address this issue, we propose a new MAC-PHY architecture design, CUTS, to allow distributed nodes effectively contend for the channel and utilize the channel in both domains. Particularly, CUTS adopts interference nulling to attach the antenna information in channel contention. Meanwhile, techniques such as channel contention in frequency domain and ACK in frequency domain using self-jamming are adopted. Through the software defined radio-based real experiments and extensive simulations, we demonstrate the feasibility of our design and illustrate that CUTS provides better channel utilization with the gain over IEEE 802.11 reaching up to 470 percent.", "paper_title": "CUTS: Improving Channel Utilization in Both Time and Spatial Domain in WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000337966400005"}
