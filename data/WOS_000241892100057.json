However, the evolutionary game theory, based on bounded rationality, can compensate these defects. In this paper, we set up an asymmetric model of the evolutionary game between a supplier and a retailer with asymmetric information. The evolutionary stable strategies and their premises were obtained with the replicator dynamics mechanism. The analysis in this paper has significance of explanation and direction for the supply chain management.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary dynamics of an asymmetric game between a supplier and a retailer", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100057"}
