The uncertainties are parametric and norm-bounded. Both robust observation and robust H-infinity observation methods are developed by using linear state-delayed observers. In case of robust observation, sufficient conditions are established for asymptotic stability of the system, which is independent of time delay. The results are then extended to robust H-infinity observation which renders the augmented system asymptotically stable independent of delay with a guaranteed performance measure. Furthermore, a memoryless state-estimate feedback is designed to stabilize the closed-loop neutral system. In all cases, the gain matrices are determined by linear matrix inequality approach. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the validity of the theoretical results. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
