Despite this, a leading scholar has expressed concerns that the IB research agenda could be 'running out of steam' (Buckley, Journal of International Business Studies 33(2):365-373, 2002), prompting on-going introspection within the IB field. We contribute to this debate by investigating the evolution of the IB field through a scientometric examination of articles published in its premier journal, the Journal of International Business Studies (JIBS) from 1970 until 2008. We introduce a new analytical tool, Leximancer, to the fields of international business and scientometry. We show an evolution from an initial and extended emphasis on macro-environmental issues to a more recent focus on micro-economic, firm-level ones with the multinational enterprise (MNE) as an organizational form enduring throughout the entire period. We observe a field that has established a justifiable claim for relevance, participating actively in the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas.", "paper_title": "The evolution of the international business field: a scientometric investigation of articles published in its premier journal", "paper_id": "WOS:000292210200002"}
