Program summary Program title: PDEBellII Catalogue identifier: AEQP_v1_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEQP_v1_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC licence, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 2170 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 43 827 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Maple internal language. Computer: PCs, Dell OptiPlex 390. Operating system: Windows XP and Windows 7. RAM: Depends on the complexity of the problem (MB) Classification: 4.3, 5. Nature of problem: Determination of integrability of the nonlinear evolution equations, including bilinear forms, bilinear Backlund transformations, Lax pairs and conservation laws. Solution method: The package PDEBellII is developed by using the Bell polynomials which is linked with Hirota operators. Restrictions: The program can only handle single nonlinear evolution equations. Unusual features: The program PDEBellII is the first Maple automatic program to construct bilinear Backlund transformations, Lax pairs and the infinite conservation laws for nonlinear evolution equations. Running time: Depends strongly on the complexity of the equation. Different tasks take from 0.4 to 20s. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
