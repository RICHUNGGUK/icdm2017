The underpinning idea of the method is to cancel lower-order errors by treating spatial Taylor expansions implicitly. Recently, some attention has been paid to conservative compact finite volume methods on staggered grid, but there is a concern about the order of accuracy after replacing cell surface integrals by average values calculated at centres of cell surfaces. Here we introduce a high-order compact finite difference method on staggered grid, without taking integration by parts. The method is implemented and assessed for an incompressible shear-driven cavity flow at Re = 10(3), a temporally periodic flow at Re = 10(4), and a spatially periodic flow at Re = 10(4). The results demonstrate the success of the method.
