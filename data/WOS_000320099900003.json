It is a generalised framework for multi-agent coordination problems, which contains or concerns a variety of important multi-agent problems in a quite unified way. Its background includes active leader following formation for the agents to maintain desired relative distances and orientations to the leader with a predefined trajectory, and multi-agent formation with environmental inputs. With the help of canonical internal model we design a distributed dynamic output feedback to handle the distributed formation output regulation problem.", "paper_title": "Distributed formation output regulation of switching heterogeneous multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900003"}
