But aspects are evident earlier in the life cycle, such as during requirements gathering and architecture development. The authors' integrated approach to working with early aspects lets you identify them and exploit them throughout the software development life cycle.", "paper_title": "Discovering early aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000234489300020"}
