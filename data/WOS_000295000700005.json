These structurally diverse inhibitors were obtained by our previously reported high-throughput in vitro screening technique using 384-well plate's assay based on colorimetric method of Ellman. QSAR models were developed using (i) genetic function algorithm, (ii) genetic partial least squares, (iii) support vector machine and (iv) artificial neural network techniques. The QSAR model robustness and significance was critically assessed using different cross-validation techniques on test data set. The generated QSAR models using thermodynamic, electrotopological and electronic descriptors showed that nonlinear methods are more robust than linear methods, and provide insight into the structural features of compounds that are important for AChE inhibition.", "paper_title": "Molecular Docking Guided Comparative GFA, G/PLS, SVM and ANN Models of Structurally Diverse Dual Binding Site Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000295000700005"}
