Learning such multi-modal models in high dimensional spaces, however, is challenging with limited training data; often resulting in over-fitting and poor generalization. To address these issues Latent Variable Models (LVMs) have been introduced. Shared LVMs learn a low dimensional representation of common causes that give rise to both the image features and the 3D pose. Discovering the shared manifold structure can, in itself, however, be challenging. In addition, shared LVM models are often non-parametric, requiring the model representation to be a function of the training set size. We present a parametric framework that addresses these shortcomings. In particular, we jointly learn latent spaces for both image features and 3D poses by maximizing the non-linear dependencies in the projected latent space, while preserving local structure in the original space; we then learn a multi-modal conditional density between these two low-dimensional spaces in the form of Gaussian Mixture Regression. With this model we can address the issue of over-fitting and generalization, since the data is denser in the learned latent space, as well as avoid the need for learning a shared manifold for the data. We quantitatively compare the performance of the proposed method to several state-of-the-art alternatives, and show that our method gives a competitive performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
