This paper introduces a modified approach to P300 wave detection combined with an application of rough set methods and non-rough set based methods to classify P300 signals. The modifications include an averaging method using Mexican hat wavelet coefficients to extract features of signals. The data set has been expanded to include signals from six words and a total of 3960 objects. Experiments with a variety of classifiers were performed. The signal data analysis includes comparisons of error rates, true positives and false negatives performed using a paired t-test. It has been found that the false negatives are better indicators of efficacy of the feature extraction method rather than error rate due to the nature of the signal data. The contribution of this paper is an in-depth study P300 wave detection using a modified averaging method for feature extraction together with rough set-based classification on an expanded data set.", "paper_title": "P300 wave detection based on rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000242418100010"}
