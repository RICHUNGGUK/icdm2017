This approach presents volumetric information through integrating context information as the structure analysis of the data set with a lens-like focal region rendering to show more detailed information. This feature-based approach contains three main components: (i) A feature extraction model using 3D image processing techniques to explore the structure of objects to provide contextual information; (ii) An efficient ray-bounded volume ray casting rendering to provide the detailed information of the volume of interest in the focal region; (iii) The tools used to manipulate focal regions to make this approach more flexible. The approach provides a powerful framework for producing detailed information from volumetric data. Providing contextual information and focal region renditions at the same time has the advantages of easy to understand and comprehend volume information for the scientist. The interaction techniques provided in this approach make the focal region-based volume rendering more flexible and easy to use.", "paper_title": "Focal region-based volume rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240665500004"}
