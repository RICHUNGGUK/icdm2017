This scheme can achieve minimal allocation of bandwidth for each client and maximal utilization of the client buffers. By adjusting the server transmission rate in response to client buffer occupancy, playback requirements in the client, variations in network delays and the packet loss rate, an acceptable quality-of-service (QoS) level can be maintained at the end systems. Our proposed scheme can also achieve end-to-end TCP-friendly congestion control, which the multimedia flows can share fairly with the TCP flows instead of starving the TCP flows and the packet loss rate is reduced. Simulations to compare with different approaches under different network congestion levels and to show how our approach achieves end-to-end congestion control and inter-protocol fairness are conducted. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can generally achieve high network utilization, low losses and end-to-end congestion control. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
