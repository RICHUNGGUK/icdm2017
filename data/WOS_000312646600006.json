In this technique, we model the motion-based video temporal alignment problem as a spatio-temporal discrete trajectory point sets alignment problem. First, the trajectory of the object of interest is tracked throughout the videos. A probabilistic method is then developed to calculate the 'soft' spatial correspondence between the trajectory point sets. Next, a dynamic time warping technique (DTW) is applied to the spatial correspondence information to compute the temporal alignment of the videos. The experimental results show that the proposed technique provides a superior performance over existing techniques for videos with similar trajectory patterns.", "paper_title": "A Robust Technique for Motion-Based Video Sequences Temporal Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000312646600006"}
