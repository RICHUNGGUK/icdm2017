In this work, two different architectures are studied: besides the classical table-based architecture, a different architecture based on a circular buffer and especially targeting FPGAs is proposed. A 30% performance improvement has been obtained when compared to the fastest previous work. The applicability of the proposed MT architectures has been proven in a high performance Gaussian RNG.", "paper_title": "High Performance FPGA-oriented Mersenne Twister Uniform Random Number Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000315444700002"}
