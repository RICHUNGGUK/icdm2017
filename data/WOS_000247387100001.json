Traditional approaches to branching variable selection rely on estimating the effect of the candidate variables on the objective function. We present a new approach that relies on estimating the impact of the candidate variables on the active constraints in the current LP relaxation. We apply this method to the problem of finding the first feasible solution as quickly as possible. Empirical experiments demonstrate a significant improvement compared to a state-of-the art commercial MIP solver.", "paper_title": "Active-constraint variable ordering for faster feasibility of mixed integer linear programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000247387100001"}
