Here, we demonstrate that Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVM) a semi-supervised large-margin classification method can be particularly useful to build the models on small and unbalanced datasets which often represent a difficult problem in QSAR. Both TSVM and ordinary SVM have been applied to build classification models on 10 DUD datasets. The transductive effect (the difference in predictive performance between transductive and ordinary support vector machines) was investigated as a function of: (a) active/inactive ratio, (b) descriptor weighting, and (c) the training and test sets size and composition.", "paper_title": "Transductive Support Vector Machines: Promising Approach to Model Small and Unbalanced Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000316575400003"}
