A decoder is more likely to deplete degree-1 encoding symbols and terminate during early stage when the code length is short. In this work, we modify the robust Soliton distribution (RSD) and increase the degree-1 proportion. More degree-1 encoding symbols can be generated to relieve early decoding termination. The proportion of low degrees, except for degree-1, is also reduced. Therefore, receivers collect less encoding symbols carrying redundant information. In addition, Non-Repetitive (NR) encoding scheme is proposed to avoid producing repeated degree-1 encoding symbols. To improve video transmission quality, previous studies redesign LT codes to provide Unequal Error Protection (UEP) for different Scalable Video Coding (SVC) layers. Unlike those studies to modify the code structure, we integrate multiple NR encoders to achieve UEP ability. Experimental results show that our UEP scheme outperforms previous studies in terms of the PSNR.", "paper_title": "Integrating Non-Repetitive LT Encoders With Modified Distribution to Achieve Unequal Erasure Protection", "paper_id": "WOS:000327393900035"}
