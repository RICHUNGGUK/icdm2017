Often, the optic nerve head (ONH) glaucomatous damage and ONH changes occur prior to visual field loss and are observable in vivo. Thus, digital image analysis is a promising choice for detecting the onset and/or progression of glaucoma. In this paper, we present a new framework for detecting glaucomatous changes in the ONH of an eye using the method of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). A baseline topograph subspace was constructed for each eye to describe the structure of the ONH of the eye at a reference/baseline condition using POD. Any glaucomatous changes in the ONH of the eye present during a follow-up exam were estimated by comparing the follow-up ONH topography with its baseline topograph subspace representation. Image correspondence measures of L(1)-norm and L(2)-norm, correlation, and image Euclidean distance (IMED) were used to quantify the ONH changes. An ONH topographic library built from the Louisiana State University Experimental Glaucoma study was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) was used to compare the diagnostic performance of the POD-induced parameters with the parameters of the topographic change analysis (TCA) method. The IMED and L(2)-norm parameters in the POD framework provided the highest AUC of 0.94 at 10 degrees. field of imaging and 0.91 at 15 degrees. field of imaging compared to the TCA parameters with an AUC of 0.86 and 0.88, respectively. The proposed POD framework captures the instrument measurement variability and inherent structure variability and shows promise for improving our ability to detect glaucomatous change over time in glaucoma management.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Detecting Glaucomatous Progression in the Optic Nerve Head of an Eye Using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000269518900013"}
