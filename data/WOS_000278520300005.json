It is shown that the asymmetry degree is an important factor influencing the network dynamics. Furthermore, a strategy for designing AHNNs of different sparsities is proposed. Numerical simulations show that AHNNs can perform as well as symmetric ones, and the diluted AHNNs have the virtues of small wiring cost and high pattern recognition quality.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of asymmetric Hopfield networks with discrete-time dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000278520300005"}
