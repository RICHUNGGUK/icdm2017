In most cases, as in data-driven fuzzy modeling, these fuzzy models reach a high performance from the point of view of accuracy, but from other points of view, such as complexity or interpretability, they can present a poor performance. Several approaches are found in the bibliography to reduce the complexity and improve the interpretability of the fuzzy models. In this paper, a post-processing approach is carried out via rule selection, whose aim is to choose the most relevant rules for working together on the well-known accuracy-interpretability trade-off. The rule relevancy is based on Orthogonal Transformations, such as the SVD-QR rank revealing approach, the P-QR and OLS transformations. Rule selection is carried out using a genetic algorithm that takes into account the information obtained by the Orthogonal Transformations. The main objective is to check the true significance, drawbacks and advantages of the rule selection based on the orthogonal transformations via the rule firing strength matrix. In order to carry out this aim, a neuro-fuzzy system, FasArt (Fuzzy Adaptive System ART based), and several case studies, data sets from the KEEL Project Repository, are used to tune and check this selection of rules based on orthogonal transformations, genetic selection and accuracy-interpretability trade-off. This neuro-fuzzy system generates Mamdani fuzzy rule based systems (FRBSs), in an approximative way. NSGA-II is the MOEA tool used to tune the proposed rule selection.", "paper_title": "CHECKING ORTHOGONAL TRANSFORMATIONS AND GENETIC ALGORITHMS FOR SELECTION OF FUZZY RULES BASED ON INTERPRETABILITY-ACCURACY CONCEPTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000308710000008"}
