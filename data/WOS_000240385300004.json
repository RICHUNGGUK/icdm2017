Its main idea is that two classical methods-split and merge techniques are applied to repair infeasible solutions. In this scheme, an infeasible solution can not only be repaired rapidly, but also be pushed to a local optimal location in the solution space. In addition, unlike the existing genetic algorithms which can only solve one type of polygonal approximation problem, SMGA can solve two types of polygonal approximation problems. The experimental results demonstrate that SMGA is robust and outperforms other existing GA-based methods.", "paper_title": "A hybrid genetic algorithm for two types of polygonal approximation problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300004"}
