It is defined by setting n coordinate axes in the visualization domain. Since it generally defines an affine projection, strong distortions can occur: an nD sphere can be mapped to an ellipse of arbitrary size and aspect ratio. We propose to restrict star coordinates to orthographic projections which map an nD sphere of radius r to a 2D circle of radius r. We achieve this by formulating conditions for the coordinate axes to define orthographic projections, and by running a repeated non-linear optimization in the background of every modification of the coordinate axes. This way, we define a number of orthographic interaction concepts as well as orthographic data tour sequences: a scatterplot tour, a principle component tour, and a grand tour. All concepts are illustrated and evaluated with synthetic and real data.", "paper_title": "Orthographic Star Coordinates", "paper_id": "WOS:000325991600067"}
