This article analyzes on-chip communication challenges and studies the characteristics of existing electrical and emerging nanophotonic interconnect. Iris, a CMOS-compatible high-performance low-power nanophotonic on-chip network, is thus introduced. Iris's circuit-switched subnetwork supports throughput-sensitive data transfer. Iris's optical-antenna-arraybased broadcast multicast subnetwork optimizes latency-critical traffic and supports the path setup of circuit-switched communication. Overall, the proposed nanophotonic network design offers an on-chip communication backplane that is power efficient while demonstrating low latency and high throughput.", "paper_title": "Iris: A Hybrid Nanophotonic Network Design for High-Performance and Low-Power on-Chip Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000292628100004"}
