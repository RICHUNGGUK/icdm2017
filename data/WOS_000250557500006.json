We give a complete answer to the open problem proposed by Patel et al., which automatically includes the solution to the original Champagne Problem. Based on the recent development in automated inequality-type theorem proving, a new stabilizing controller design method is established. Our numerical examples significantly improve the relevant results in the literature.", "paper_title": "Solution to the Generalized Champagne Problem on simultaneous stabilization of linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250557500006"}
