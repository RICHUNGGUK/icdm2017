In this paper, we propose it newly improved and practical algorithm for joining multiple streams called AM Join, which improves the Multiple join performance by guaranteeing the detection of Join failures in constant time. To achieve this goal. we first design a new data Structure called BiHT (Bit-vector Hash Table) and present the overall behavior of AMJoin in detail. In addition, we show various experimental results and their analyses for clarifying its efficiency and practicability.", "paper_title": "AMJoin: An Advanced Join Algorithm for Multiple Data Streams Using a Bit-Vector Hash Table", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200012"}
