Yang, T.-Y. Chang and M.-S. Hwang proposed an efficient multi-secret sharing scheme based on two-variable one-way function and Shamir's secret sharing. In order to add the verifiable property into previous scheme, J. Shao and Z. Cao proposed an efficient (t,n) verifiable multi-secret sharing based on YCH [C.-C. Yang, T.-Y. Chang, M.-S. Hwang, A (t,n) multi-secret sharing scheme, Applied Mathematics and Computation 151 (2004) pp. 483-490.] in 2005. Both of the previous schemes need a secure channel. This paper presents a verifiable multi-secret sharing based on YCH, intractability of Discrete Logarithm (DL) and RSA cryptosystem. In our scheme each participant chooses her/his shadow by her/himself and there is not any need to a secure channel. In addition, compared with Shao and Cao scheme, verifiable property is more efficient in our scheme. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
