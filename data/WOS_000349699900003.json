Automated web service composition can be performed using AI Planning techniques, utilizing descriptions of available atomic web services, enhanced with semantic awareness and relaxation. This paper discusses a unified, semantically aware approach, handling both semantic (OWL-S & SAWSDL) and non-semantic (WSDL) web service descriptions. In the first case, ontology analysis is adopted to semantically enhance the planning domains and problems, in order to deal with cases where exact syntactic input-to-output matching is not feasible. In the non-semantic descriptions case, semantic information is acquired utilizing alternative sources such as lexical thesauri. Concept similarity measures are applied and utilized to achieve the desired degree of semantic relaxation. The solution to a web service composition problem is a plan describing the desired composite service. To support the proposed approach, the PORSCE framework has been implemented. The framework is modular, integrating discrete web service description languages and semantic relaxation techniques. Based on the similarity measures suggested in the paper, performance issues are also explored.", "paper_title": "Semantically Aware Web Service Composition Through AI Planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000349699900003"}
