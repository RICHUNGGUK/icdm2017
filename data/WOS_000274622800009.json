The additional benefits of the WLAN interface are, however, likely to be outweighed by its greater rate of energy consumption. This is especially of concern when real-time applications, that result in continuous traffic, are involved. WLAN radios typically conserve energy by staying in sleep mode. With real-time applications like Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), this can be challenging since packets delayed above a threshold are lost. Moreover, the continuous nature of traffic makes it difficult for the radio to stay in the lower power sleep mode enough to reduce energy consumption significantly. In this work, we propose the GreenCall algorithm to derive sleep/wake-up schedules for the WLAN radio to save energy during VoIP calls while ensuring that application quality is preserved within acceptable levels of users. We evaluate GreenCall on commodity hardware and study its performance over diverse network paths and describe our experiences in the process. We further extensively investigate the effect of different application parameters on possible energy savings through trace-based simulations. We show that, in spite of the interactive, real-time nature of voice, energy consumption during calls can be reduced by close to 80 percent in most instances.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient VoIP over Wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000274622800009"}
