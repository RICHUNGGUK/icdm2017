The method mainly deals with a large Matrix-Vector Product where the matrix elements must be calculated on the fly in such a way that the problem fits in main memory. To prove the performance of the heterogeneous implementations, the tool is tested using one NVIDIA K20c GPU, one Intel Xeon Phi 5110P, and two Intel Xeon E5-2650 CPUs. The speedup of the accelerated implementations ranges from (Xeon Phi) to (Xeon Phi K20c) when compared to our parallel CPU code with threads. This work, combined with the authors' previous works for the computation of the acoustic pressure over the obstacle surface, results in a valuable toolset for noise control applications during aircraft design.", "paper_title": "Aircraft noise scattering prediction using different accelerator architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000344552400010"}
