Let F be any non-trivial minor-closed family of graphs. We show that mcc(2)(G) = O(n(2/3)) for any n-vertex graph G is an element of F. This bound is asymptotically optimal and it is attained for planar graphs. More generally, for every such F, and every fixed t we show that mcc(t)(G) = O(n(2)/((t+1))). On the other hand, we have examples of graphs G with no Kt+3 minor and with mcc(t)(G) = Omega(n(2/(2t-1))). It is also interesting to consider graphs of bounded degrees. Haxell, Szabo and Tardos proved mcc(2)(G) <= 20000 for every graph G of maximum degree 5. We show that there are n-vertex 7-regular graphs G with mcc(2)(G) = Omega(n), and more sharply, for every epsilon > 0 there exists c(epsilon) > 0 and n-venex graphs of maximum degree 7, average degree at most 6 + epsilon for all subgraphs, and with mcc(2)(G) > c(epsilon)n. For 6-regular graphs it is known only that the maximum order of magnitude of mcc(2) is between root n and n. We also offer a Ramsey-theoretic perspective of the quantity mcc(t)(G).", "paper_title": "Graph colouring with no large monochromatic components", "paper_id": "WOS:000258173600009"}
