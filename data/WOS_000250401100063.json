We suspect this is because it is very complicated and time consuming to adjust the parameters to achieve meaningful results. The clinician has to take care of the appropriate viewpoint, zooming, transfer function setup, clipping planes and other parameters. Because of this, most often only 2D slices of the data set are examined. Our work introduces LiveSync, a new concept to synchronize 2D slice views and volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with expressive result images. To achieve this live synchronization we use a minimal set of derived information without the need for segmented data sets or data-specific pre-computations. The components we consider are the picked point, slice view zoom, patient orientation, viewpoint history, local object shape and visibility. We introduce deformed viewing spheres which encode the viewpoint quality for the components. A combination of these deformed viewing spheres is used to estimate a good viewpoint. Our system provides the physician with synchronized views which help to gain deeper insight into the medical data with minimal user interaction.", "paper_title": "LiveSync: Deformed viewing spheres for knowledge-based navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000250401100063"}
