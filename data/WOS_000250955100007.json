The aims of the paper are to create a user model and to use this model to explain the performance of a collaborative filtering approach. A number of user and group features are defined and the performance of a collaborative filtering system in producing recommendations for users with different feature values is tested. Graph-based representations of the collaborative filtering space are presented and these are used to de. ne some of the user and group features as well as being used in a recommendation task.", "paper_title": "Identifying user and group information from collaborative filtering datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955100007"}
