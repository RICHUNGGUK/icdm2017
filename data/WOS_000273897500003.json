These equations provide mean field dynamics for the. ring rate or activity of neurons within a network given some connectivity. The shortcoming of these equations is that they take into account only the average. ring rate, while leaving out higher-order statistics like correlations between. ring. A stochastic theory of neural networks that includes statistics at all orders was recently formulated. We describe how this theory yields a systematic extension to population rate equations by introducing equations for correlations and appropriate coupling terms. Each level of the approximation yields closed equations; they depend only on the mean and specific correlations of interest, without an ad hoc criterion for doing so. We show in an example of an all-to-all connected network how our system of generalized activity equations captures phenomena missed by the mean field rate equations alone.", "paper_title": "Systematic Fluctuation Expansion for Neural Network Activity Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000273897500003"}
