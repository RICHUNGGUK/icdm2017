In this paper, we present a new method for dealing with fuzzy rule interpolation in sparse fuzzy rule-based systems based on the principle membership functions and uncertainty grade functions of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The proposed method deals with fuzzy rule interpolation based on the principle membership functions and the uncertainty grade functions of interval type-2 fuzzy sets. It can deal with fuzzy rule interpolation with polygonal interval type-2 fuzzy sets and can handle fuzzy rule interpolation with multiple antecedent variables. We also use some examples to compare the fuzzy interpolative reasoning results of the proposed method with the ones of an existing method. The experimental result shows that the proposed method gets more reasonable results than the existing method for fuzzy rule interpolation based on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
