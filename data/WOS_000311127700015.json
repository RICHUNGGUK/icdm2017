This approach reduces the space and time-varying deblurring problem to a shift invariant one. It first registers each frame to suppress geometric deformation through B-spline-based nonrigid registration. Next, a temporal regression process is carried out to produce an image from the registered frames, which can be viewed as being convolved with a space invariant near-diffraction-limited blur. Finally, a blind deconvolution algorithm is implemented to deblur the fused image, generating a final output. Experiments using real data illustrate that this approach can effectively alleviate blur and distortions, recover details of the scene, and significantly improve visual quality.", "paper_title": "Removing Atmospheric Turbulence via Space-Invariant Deconvolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000311127700015"}
