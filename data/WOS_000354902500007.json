This protocol will allow the user to select a subset of data from an archive in a standard way, based on the IVOA Table Access Protocol (TAP). The TAP mechanism is completed by an underlying Data Model and reference dictionaries. This paper describes the principle of the EPN-TAP protocol and interfaces, underlines the choices that have been made, and discusses possible evolutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
