Traditional client - server approaches allocate a dedicated stream from the server for each client request, which is expensive and doesn't scale well. By using end hosts' huge bandwidth and computational capacity, peer-to-peer technologies shed new light on media streaming applications' development. Yet, locating supplying peers and content delivery path maintenance are two major challenges in this area.", "paper_title": "Challenges and approaches in large-scale P2P media streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000245303800007"}
