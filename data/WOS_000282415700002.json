To facilitate the development of these applications, computer models are being developed to simulate gaseous injection, air entrainment and the ensuing combustion. This paper introduces a new method for modelling the injection process of gaseous fuels that aims to hold down grid requirements in order to allow the simulation also of other phenomena, like combustion or valve and piston motion, in reciprocating internal combustion engines. After a short overview of existing models, the transient jet model and the evaluation of inflow conditions are described in detail. Then a basic study of the grid effects on the jet evolution is presented. The model is updated and validated by comparing numerical results with available experimental data for two different operating conditions: a subsonic and a supersonic under-expanded case. The model demonstrates to be fast enough to be used in a multi-dimensional code and accurate enough to follow the real gas jet evolution.
