We consider an amplify-and-forward relay network with beamforming at the base station and all the mobile stations, and derive closed-form lower and upper bounds on the outage probabilities of two unidirectional links, respectively. Moreover, the exact expression for the diversity order and the asymptotic expressions for the outage probabilities of two unidirectional links are given too. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify our formulations.", "paper_title": "Diversity order of multiuser two-way relay networks with beamforming over Nakagami-m fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000293465200019"}
