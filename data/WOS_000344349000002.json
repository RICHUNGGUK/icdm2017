Given a function of free-surface elevation, the algorithm checks for the intersection of the body with the free surface and, based on user-defined parameters, modifies the initial mesh, by subdividing the elements where necessary and eliminating others, via a quadtree approach. Redundant sub-divisions, generated in the quad-division process, are partially eliminated, but the quadrilateral nature of the elements is always kept. The free-surface function must be single-valued and its definition domain simply connected. Hydrostatic and Froude-Krylov forces are computed exactly on each panel by means of analytical formulations, which are derived and presented, based on the theory of linear gravity waves and from applying Green's theorem.
