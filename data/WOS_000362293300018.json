Using this interpretation, we obtain an efficient implementation that only requires tracing flow-lines and re-sampling the image. We show that the approach is stable, allowing the use of arbitrarily large time steps without requiring a linear solve. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of the approach by extending it to the processing of signals on meshes in 3D.", "paper_title": "Unconditionally Stable Shock Filters for Image and Geometry Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000362293300018"}
