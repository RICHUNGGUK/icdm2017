One major challenge is how to comprehend service-specific semantics and how to generate workflow to reuse common service composition functionalities. Current ontological specifications for semantically describing properties of Grid services are limited to their static interface description. In this paper, we present an automaton [1, 2] model in which service providers express their service-specific knowledge in the form of a service template and create composition plan that is used by a synthesizer to perform dynamic configuring composition automatically. Our main contribution is to formally describe dynamic processing of composition, to take QoS-driven composition goal into account to find best quality composition on Semantic Grid.", "paper_title": "Dynamic configuring service on semantic grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700015"}
