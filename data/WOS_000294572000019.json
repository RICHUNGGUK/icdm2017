Design We parsed the Sig strings from a sample of 20 161 de-identified ambulatory e-prescriptions into variables representing the fields of the Structured and Codified Sig Format. A stratified random sample of these representations was then reviewed by a group of experts. For codified Sig fields, we attempted to map the actual words used by prescribers to the equivalent terms in the designated terminology. Measurements Proportion of prescriptions that the Format could fully represent; proportion of terms used that could be mapped to the designated terminology. Results The fields defined in the Format could fully represent 95% of Sigs 195% CI 93% to 97%), but ambiguities were identified, particularly in representing multiple-step instructions. The terms used by prescribers could be codified for only 60% of dose delivery methods, 84% of dose forms, 82% of vehicles, 95% of routes, 70% of sites, 33% of administration timings, and 93% of indications. Limitations The findings are based on a retrospective sample of ambulatory prescriptions derived mostly from primary care physicians. Conclusion The fields defined in the Format could represent most of the patient instructions in a large prescription sample, but prior to its mandatory adoption, further work is needed to ensure that potential ambiguities are addressed and that a complete set of terms is available for the codified fields.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of the NCPDP Structured and Codified Sig Format for e-prescriptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000294572000019"}
