Recently, multi-resolution analysis such as wavelet decompositions provides very good multi-resolution analytical tools for different scales of pavement analysis and distresses classification. In this paper an expert system is proposed for pavement distress classification. A radon neural network, based on wavelet transform expert system is used for increasing the effectiveness of the scale invariant feature extraction algorithm. Wavelet modulus is calculated and Radon transform is then applied to the wavelet modulus. The features and parameters of the peaks are finally used for training and testing the neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed expert system is an effective method for pavement distress classification. The test performances of this study show the advantages of proposed expert system: it is rapid, easy to operate, and have simple structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
