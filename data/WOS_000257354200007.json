While most of the existing literature of economics-based Grid resource allocation relies on the basic microeconomic principle, which concerns the behavior of individual agents in the Grid, this paper provides a novel approach based on macroeconomics, which concerns large aggregate behavior instead of individual actions. First, we propose a macroeconomics-based market framework that is well suited for a service-oriented Grid. Then, some macroeconomics-based resource allocation strategies, which can effectively improve the performance of the whole Grid market, are given. Simulation results prove good performance of the proposed method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
