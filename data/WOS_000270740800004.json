In this work we propose a real-time object tracking algorithm, based on the hybridization of particle filtering (PF) and a multi-scale local search (MSLS) algorithm, presented for both CPU and GPU architectures. The developed system provides successful results in precise tracking of single and multiple targets in monocular video, operating in real-time at 70 frames per second for 640 x 480 video resolutions on the GPU, up to 1,100% faster than the CPU version of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Multiscale and local search methods for real time region tracking with particle filters: local search driven by adaptive scale estimation on GPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000270740800004"}
