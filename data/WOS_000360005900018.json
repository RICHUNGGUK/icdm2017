To be more practical, we assume that the communication topology arbitrarily switches among a finite set of directed topologies, each of which is only required to have a directed spanning tree. Moreover, we assume that there are impulsive effects in the process of signal exchanging. We will show that all the stochastic dynamical neural networks can achieve exponential synchronization even if only a single impulsive controller is exerted. Some sufficient synchronization criteria are given based on multiple Lyapunov theory. A simple example is presented to show the application of the criteria obtained in this paper.", "paper_title": "Stochastic synchronization of coupled delayed neural networks with switching topologies via single pinning impulsive control", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005900018"}
