To date, there has been little queueing theoretic modeling conducted of such systems that provide a quantitative estimate of the benefits from CRSN. We propose a novel queuing model which incorporates service rate and functional heterogeneity on the servers and implement preemptive priority among the varying service classes. Initially, we present a continuous-time Markov chain for performance analysis of CRSN for two colocated cognitive systems with various priority classes and bandwidth requirements. Closed form results for spectrum utilization, blocking probability, and optimal traffic intensities are then derived for the scenario of two heterogeneous secondary systems. A channel packing scheme is then proposed to pack smaller bandwidth users into clusters of adjacent channels to alleviate blockage of users requiring larger bandwidth requirements. Based on the numerical results of benefits of our scheme, we propose a feasible application for smart grid.", "paper_title": "Heterogeneous Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks for Smart Grid: Markov Analysis and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000363145800001"}
