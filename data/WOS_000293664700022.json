In this paper, a joint angle measurement method using Kalman filter to correct gyroscope signals from accelerometer signals was examined in measurement of hip, knee and ankle joint angles with a wireless wearable sensor system, in which the sensors were attached on the body without exact positioning. The lower limb joint angles of three healthy subjects were measured during gait with the developed sensor system and a 3D motion measurement system in order to evaluate the measurement accuracy. Then, 10 m walking measurement was performed under different walking speeds with a healthy subject in order to find the usefulness of the system as a simplified gait analysis system. The joint angles were measured with reasonable accuracy, and the system showed joint angle changes that were similar to those shown in a previous report as walking speed changed. It would be necessary to examine the influence of sensor attachment position and method for more stable measurement, and also to study other parameters for gait evaluation.", "paper_title": "Kalman-Filtering-Based Joint Angle Measurement with Wireless Wearable Sensor System for Simplified Gait Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664700022"}
