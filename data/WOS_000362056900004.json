In the past two years, the first chemotypes of positive or silent allosteric modulators (PAMs or SAMs, respectively) of mu- and delta-opioid receptor types have been reported in the literature. During a structure-guided lead optimization campaign with mu-PAMs BMS-986121 and BMS-986122 as starting compounds, we discovered a new chemotype that was confirmed to display mu-PAM or mu-SAM activity depending on the specific substitutions as assessed by endomorphin-1-stimulated beta-arrestin2 recruitment assays in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-mu PathHunter cells. The most active mu-PAM of this series was analyzed further in competition binding and G-protein activation assays to understand its effects on ligand binding and to investigate the nature of its probe dependence.", "paper_title": "Ligand-Based Discovery of a New Scaffold for Allosteric Modulation of the mu-Opioid Receptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000362056900004"}
