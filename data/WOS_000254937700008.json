To solve the VDP/CD/MD, A hierarchical multiplex structure (HIMS++) calculation model is proposed. The HIMS++ model takes advantage of object-oriented modeling, heuristic method, and fuzzy inference in (atomic, molecular, individual) three layers, so it can find a utility decision (vehicles plan) close to expert dispatcher. Furthermore, since the vital input parameters are few and the computational engine is packaged into a software component, the HIMS++ model is a convenient tool for the VDP/CD/MD. The HIMS++ model and its optimization algorithm are implemented as a software component using object-oriented paradigm, and through metaprogramming. The performance of the HIMS++ model is evaluated through experiments using 3-days oil delivery data taken from an actual dispatching center in Tokyo area. A total of 27 tank lorries are available for daily cooperative deliveries from three depots to about 30-60 destinations with different owners are used to save a running cost. The experimental results and the evaluations by human experts confirm that the HIMS++ model is better than the results of experienced dispatchers in six evaluation objectives, and can be applied to the planning support system for the VDP/CD/MD. The HIMS++ model will be able to cover similar transportation problems in the real world.
