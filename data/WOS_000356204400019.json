Service contracts are defined by the service-level agreement or service portfolio, and a new application will require on-demand services provided by existing systems. No previous research has considered the features of system services required for the execution of a dynamic strategy, which cannot be fulfilled by existing system services. In contrast, an SOA can support the execution of an enterprise's strategy in an environment with dynamic changes. This paper presents a proposed methodology based on business strategies to help construct a service-oriented information system, and a model-driven architecture that was used to verify this methodology.", "paper_title": "An SOA-Based System Modeling Methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000356204400019"}
