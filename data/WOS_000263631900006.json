Specifically. for a QSIC we consider its Singularity, reducibility. the number of its components, and the degree of each irreducible component, etc. There are in total 35 different types of non-degenerate quadric pencils. For each of the 35 types of QSICs given by these non-degenerate pencils, through a detailed Study of the eigenvalue curve and the index function jump we establish a characterizing algebraic condition expressed in terms of the Segre characteristics and the signature sequence of the quadric pencil. We show how to compute a signature sequence with rational arithmetic and use it to determine the type of the intersection Curve of any two quadrics which form a non-degenerate pencil. As an example of application, we discuss how to apply our results to collision detection of cones in 3D affine space.
