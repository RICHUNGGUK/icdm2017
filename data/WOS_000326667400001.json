In fact, the non-smoothness of contact surfaces discretized by finite elements shows to be a key problem to the simulation accuracy. The smoothing technique is based on building a higher order quadratic interpolation of the curved surface, using the node positions and their normal vectors, as proposed by Nagata. Within a local and easy to parallelize procedure, accurate normal vectors are calculated at each node from the existing discretized surface by considering a patch of surrounding elements and following a normal voting strategy. Corner and edges are automatically detected by analysing eigenvalues of derived covariant matrix. The efficiency and reliability of the resulting contact model are assessed on several examples, such as ironing a bulk parallelepiped or a plate, before being applied to metal forming processes, such as wire drawing, rolling of long products and orbital forging.
