When database is heavily loaded, the crowded redo log writing queue will become a performance bottleneck. In this paper, the operation principle of database redo log is analyzed. It is found that if redo log is stored on virtual memory disk directly, the database will demonstrate better performance. In addition, the reliability of redo log system based on virtual memory disk is analyzed. At the end of the paper, a contrastive performance measurement result is given.", "paper_title": "A database redo log system based on virtual memory disk", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300086"}
