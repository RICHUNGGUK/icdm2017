Through the adoption of chaotic encryption scheme, iJADE CMS demonstrates how agent-based copyright protection can be successfully applied to digital media publishing industry. From the application perspective, iJADE (TM) CNIS provides the state-of-the-art content management function by the integration of iJADE (TM) Technology with the Ontological Agent Technology. iJADE (TM) CMS assists user to organize the content in the most semantic way. Moreover, the web mining information retrieval method such as Term Frequency Times Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) scheme is adopted to mine the linguistic meaning of the information content.", "paper_title": "iJADE content management system (CMS) - An intelligent multi-agent based content management system with chaotic copyright protection scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600084"}
