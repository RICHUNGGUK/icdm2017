The mislabeled samples deteriorate supervised learning procedures. The LOOE-sensitivity algorithm is an approach for mislabeled sample detection for microarray based on data perturbation. However, the failure of measuring the perturbing effect makes the LOOE-sensitivity algorithm a poor performance. The purpose of this article is to design a novel detection method for mislabeled samples of microarray, which could take advantage of the measuring effect of data perturbations. Results: To measure the effect of data perturbation, we de. ne an index named perturbing influence value (PIV), based on the support vector machine (SVM) regression model. The Column Algorithm (CAPIV), Row Algorithm (RAPIV) and progressive Row Algorithm (PRAPIV) based on the PIV value are proposed to detect the mislabeled samples. Experimental results obtained by using six artificial datasets and five microarray datasets demonstrate that all proposed methods in this article are superior to LOOE-sensitivity. Moreover, compared with the simple SVM and CL-stability, the PRAPIV algorithm shows an increase in precision and high recall.", "paper_title": "Methods for labeling error detection in microarrays based on the effect of data perturbation on the regression model", "paper_id": "WOS:000270685200012"}
