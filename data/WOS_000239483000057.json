The architecture of CANS consist of a two-dimensional (2D) array of basic neurons. Each neuron of CANS has local connections only with contiguous neuron and acts as a form of pulse according to the dynamics of the chaotic neuron model. CANS are generated from initial cells according to the cellular automata (CA) rule. Therefore neural architecture is determined by both initial pattern of cells and production rule of CA. Production rules of CA are evolved based on a DNA coding. DNA coding has the redundancy and overlapping of gene and is apt for representation of the rule. In this paper we show the general expression of CA rule and propose translating method from DNA code to CA rule. In addition, we present visual servoing application using evolutionary CANS.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary cellular automata based neural systems for visual servoing", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000057"}
