Its performance was evaluated with male and female sung-vowel stimuli in quiet, and in white noise and babble noise. The error rates of the developed F-0 estimator were much lower than those of a temporal F-0 estimator that was previously used in CI sound processors, and were comparable to the published error rates of F-0 estimators that were designed for other applications and evaluated with speech or musical instrument stimuli. It is envisaged that the experimental F-0 estimator will be used in advanced CI coding strategies to improve the perception of pitch by CI users, which may result in improved perception of musical sounds, as well as improved speech perception for tonal languages.
