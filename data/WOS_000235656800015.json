For that, we show that the embedding of the language of set theory into lambda Z via the 'sets as pointed graphs' translation makes lambda Z a conservative extension of IZ + AFA + TC (intuitionistic Zermelo's set theory plus Aczel's antifoundation axiom plus the axiom of transitive closure)-a theory which is equiconsistent to Zermelo's. The proof of conservativity is achieved by defining a retraction from lambda Z to a (skolemised version of) Zermelo's set theory and by showing that both transformations commute via the axioms AFA and TC.", "paper_title": "lambda Z: Zermelo's set theory as a PTS with 4 sorts", "paper_id": "WOS:000235656800015"}
