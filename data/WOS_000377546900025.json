It has been shown that the derived expression is a convex function of the energy detector's threshold. Using the derived expression, latency involved in performing cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) over CR network is studied and a dynamic spectrum sensing cycle is proposed to reduce the overall system latency.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing Over kappa - mu Shadowed Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900025"}
