The genuinely multidimensional formulation is based on the work of Balsara [17]. In the present approach, the missing contact wave in the HLL type solver is restored using the HLL-CPS formulation of Mandal and Panwar [5]. A few two-dimensional standard test cases are solved to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solver. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
