The most commonly used method in previous literature on the target coverage problem is to divide continuous time into discrete slots of different lengths, each of which is dominated by a subset of sensors while setting all the other sensors into the sleep state to save energy. This method, however, suffers from shortcomings such as high computational complexity and no performance bound. We showed that the partial target coverage problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time. First, we built a linear programming formulation, which considers the total time that a sensor spends on covering targets, in order to obtain a lifetime upper bound. Based on the information derived in previous formulation, we developed a sensor assignment algorithm to seek an optimal schedule meeting the lifetime upper bound. A formal proof of optimality was provided. We compared the proposed algorithm with the well-known column generation algorithm and showed that the proposed algorithm significantly improves performance in terms of computational time. Experiments were conducted to study the impact of different network parameters on the network lifetime, and their results led us to several interesting insights.
