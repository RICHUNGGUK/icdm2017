Our approach is to overcome the poor data validity in WSNs, specifically for harsh application environments - such as unattended sensor nodes or frail wireless transmitting channels - where fault tolerant becomes a vital aspect. Using adjacency information, Greedy negative pressure push algorithm can efficiently grow the transmitting path to achieve the minimum energy consumption for relays model. Here, we measured packet travel time and the expectation of relay distance to set this model's key parameters to achieve the lowest possible end-to-end transmitting delay. Dynamic local stitching algorithm has a major difference with other existing routing algorithms in rectifying broken paths: despite others that reroute whole paths, our algorithms only stitch broken fragments of the original path spending minimum amount of energy as well as recovery time. Based on mathematical computing and simulation, our novel rectification algorithm could effectively (1) reduce the total number of routing overheads, (2) improve net throughput, and (3) increase system fault tolerant much better than four already designed routing algorithms. Results were also very promising to motivate other algorithms in this field. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
