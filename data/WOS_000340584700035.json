More inverter states can be generated by a five-level inverter which improves voltage selection capability. This paper also introduces two different control methods to select the appropriate output voltage vector for reducing the torque and flux error to zero. The first is based on the conventional DTC scheme using a pair of hysteresis comparators and look up table to select the output voltage vector for controlling the torque and flux. The second is based on a new fuzzy logic controller using Sugeno as the inference method to select the output voltage vector by replacing the hysteresis comparators and lookup table in the conventional DTC, to which the results show more reduction in torque ripple and feasibility of smooth stator current. By using Matlab/Simulink, it is verified that using five-level inverter in DTC drive can reduce the torque ripple in comparison with conventional DTC, and further torque ripple reduction is obtained by applying fuzzy logic controller. The simulation results have also verified that using a fuzzy controller instead of a hysteresis controller has resulted in reduction in the flux ripples significantly as well as reduces the total harmonic distortion of the stator current to below 4 %.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy logic controller and cascade inverter for direct torque control of IM", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700035"}
