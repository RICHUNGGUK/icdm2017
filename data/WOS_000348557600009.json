RIFT is free of interpolation and can avoid errors introduced by interpolation. Numerous validations performed using various functional forms, levels of data-density contrast, and data discrepancies demonstrate that RIFT is accurate and robust. The advantage of RIFT over the commonly used least-squares objective function is demonstrated. In addition, the applicability of RIFT as an objective function in inverse analysis is verified in two synthetic geotechnical engineering applications: laboratory tests and an excavation.
