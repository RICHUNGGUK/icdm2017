In this paper we categorize various types of attacks and countermeasures related to trust schemes in WSNs. Furthermore, we provide the development of trust mechanisms, give a short summarization of classical trust methodologies and emphasize the challenges of trust scheme in WSNs. An extensive literature survey is presented by summarizing state-of-the-art trust mechanisms in two categories: secure routing and secure data. Based on the analysis of attacks and the existing research, an open field and future direction with trust mechanisms in WSNs is provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
