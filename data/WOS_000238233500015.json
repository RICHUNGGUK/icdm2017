The SNA uses crossbar routers to provide the increasing demand on communication bandwidth within a single chip. A switch wrapper for SNA is located between a crossbar router and IPs connecting them together. It carries out a mode of routing to assist crossbar routers and executes protocol conversions to provide compatibility in IP reuse. A switch wrapper consists of a direct router, two AHB-SNP converters, a controller and two optional interface socket modules. We implemented a SNP switch wrapper in VHDL and confirmed its functionality using ModelDim simulation. Also, we synthesized it using a Xilinx Virtex2 device to determine resource requirements: the switch wrapper seems to occupy appropriate spaces, about 900 gates, considering that a single SNA crossbar router costs about 20,000 gates.", "paper_title": "Design a switch wrapper for SNA on-chip-network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500015"}
