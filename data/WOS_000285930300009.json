The IIS is formed as hybrid agent architecture, by the synthesis of object properties, manipulation task characteristics, grasp space partitioning, low-level kinematical analysis, evaluation of contact wrench patterns via fuzzy approximate reasoning and ANN structure for incremental learning. The IIS is implemented in software with a robot hand simulation.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent Inference System for Robot Hand Optimal Grasp Preshaping", "paper_id": "WOS:000285930300009"}
