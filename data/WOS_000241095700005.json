Ontology mapping is required for combining distributed and heterogeneous ontologies. Developing such ontology mapping has been a core issue of recent ontology research. This paper presents ontology mapping categories, describes the characteristics of each category, compares these characteristics, and surveys tools, systems, and related work based on each category of ontology mapping. We believe this paper provides readers with a comprehensive understanding of ontology mapping and points to various research topics about the specific roles of ontology mapping.", "paper_title": "A survey on ontology mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000241095700005"}
