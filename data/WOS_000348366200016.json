In contrast to common treatment in matching of interest points, we use the epipolar geometry to constrain coplanarity conditions between line-pairs. This treatment eliminates the potential matching problems due to the incomplete line observations with nonmatching endpoints. This observation is used to detect a set of candidate line-pair correspondences. These matching pairs are then verified via local homography transforms derived from the neighboring interest point correspondences. This step results in a line affinity matrix, which is processed to obtain matching lines. During this process, we do not use appearance models and show that the proposed treatment performs better than the state-of-the-art appearance and geometry-based methods, especially for images with wide-baseline.", "paper_title": "Line Matching in Wide-Baseline Stereo: A Top-Down Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366200016"}
