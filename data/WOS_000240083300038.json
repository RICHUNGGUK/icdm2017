One of the main contributions of this paper is to establish the connection between k-modes and k-median, i.e., the optimum of k-median is at most the twice the optimum of k-modes for the same categorical data clustering problem. Based on this observation, we derive a deterministic algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of 2. Furthermore, we prove that the distance measure in k-modes defines a metric. Hence, we are able to extend existing approximation algorithms for metric k-median to k-modes. Empirical results verify the superiority of our method.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for K-modes clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300038"}
