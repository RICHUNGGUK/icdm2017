Based on the concept of grid computing, the paper designed and developed a distributed simulation system named DSoG with the responsiveness of locally autonomous sub-systems where each participant defined behavior and their relationships with others. Based on multi-layer decomposition, the distributed simulation system introduced was generic enough to allow the description of divers applications, while different levels of detail were also supported. DSoG provided a flexible environment for defining, modifying and simulating the component-based aero gas turbine models, and enables users to customize and extend the framework to add new functionality or adapt simulation behavior as required. At last, a distributed aero engine model was constructed and simulated to illustrate the use of the system. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
