Hence, effective management of prosumers has become pivotal to ensure a long-term, sustainable energy-sharing process. Recently, the concept of a Prosumer Community Group (PCG) has emerged as one of the most promising and effective ways to manage prosumers. However, developing sustainable PCGs is challenging. One of the key challenges in this regard is to assess the contribution made by individual prosumers of a PCG, and find a subset of the most influential prosumers whose behavior would facilitate the long-term sustainability of the PCG. In this paper, we have focused on this challenge and proposed an innovative methodology to assess and rank the prosumers, in order to build an influential membership base. We have assessed the long-term and short-term energy behaviors of prosumers based on multiple evaluation criteria and accordingly decided the ranks of the prosumers, whereby the higher ranked prosumers are deemed to be more influential in enhancing the long-term sustenance of the PCG. Furthermore, we have presented simulation results to verify our proposed methodology. The current literature on smart-grid research field has no work investigating this challenge, making our contribution novel.", "paper_title": "A Methodology to Find Influential Prosumers in Prosumer Community Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600070"}
