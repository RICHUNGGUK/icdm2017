Previous work mainly focuses on simple event detection in sports and news videos, or abnormality detection in surveillance videos. In contrast, we focus on detecting more complicated and generic events that gain more users' interest, and we explore an effective solution for MED. Moreover, our solution only uses few positive examples since precisely labeled multimedia content is scarce in the real world. As the information from these few positive examples is limited, we propose using knowledge adaptation to facilitate event detection. Different from the state of the art, our algorithm is able to adapt knowledge from another source for MED even if the features of the source and the target are partially different, but overlapping. Avoiding the requirement that the two domains are consistent in feature types is desirable as data collection platforms change or augment their capabilities and we should be able to respond to this with little or no effort. We perform extensive experiments on real-world multimedia archives consisting of several challenging events. The results show that our approach outperforms several other state-of-the-art detection algorithms.", "paper_title": "Knowledge Adaptation with Partially Shared Features for Event Detection Using Few Exemplars", "paper_id": "WOS:000340210100007"}
