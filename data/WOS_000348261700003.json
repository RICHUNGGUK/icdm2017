This is true for GMM supervector systems, joint factor analysis systems, and most recently i-vector systems. In all of these systems, the posterior probabilities and sufficient statistics calculations represent a computational bottleneck in both enrollment and testing. We propose a multi-layered hash system, employing a tree-structured GMM UBM which uses Runnalls' Gaussian mixture reduction technique, in order to reduce the number of these calculations. With this tree-structured hash, we can trade-off reduction in computation with a corresponding degradation of equal error rate (EER). As an example, we reduce this computation by a factor of 15x while incurring less than 10% relative degradation of EER (or 0.3% absolute EER) when evaluated with NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) telephone data.
