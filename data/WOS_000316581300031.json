This is especially true when an incident occurs unexpectedly that violates the criteria of suitable storage conditions. Improper incident handling and storage conditions may cause damage to the taste of wine, resulting in depreciation of the wine's value. Therefore, controlling and monitoring risk in real-time during wine storage is critical to providing a quick response to prevent the wine quality from deterioration. In this paper, a RFID-based risk control and monitoring system (RCMS), which integrates radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and case-based reasoning (CBR), is proposed for monitoring real-time physical storage conditions and for formulating an immediate action plan for handling incidents. In the retrieval process of the CBR engine, genetic algorithms (GA) are applied to search for case clusters by considering the best combination of multi-dimensional parameters. With the help of RCMS, a shortlist of critical control actions, possible causes of incidents and corresponding actions can be generated to reduce the risk of deteriorating wine quality and possible compensation costs being incurred, while customer satisfaction can be maintained.
