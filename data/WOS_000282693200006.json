The algebraic representation of a quantum observable structure in the relational local terms of sheaf theory effectuates a semantic transition from the axiomatic set-theoretic context of orthocomplemented partially ordered sets, [image omitted] la Birkhoff and Von Neumann, to the categorical topos-theoretic context of Boolean information sieves, [image omitted] la Grothendieck. The representation schema is based on the existence of a categorical adjunction, which is used as a theoretical platform for the development of a functorial formulation of information transfer, between quantum observables and Boolean localisation devices in typical quantum measurement situations. We also establish precise criteria of integrability and invariance of quantum information transfer by cohomological means.", "paper_title": "Boolean information sieves: a local-to-global approach to quantum information", "paper_id": "WOS:000282693200006"}
