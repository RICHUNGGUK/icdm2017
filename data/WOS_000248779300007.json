This problem can also be thought of as the problem of formal equality-testing of multi-variate expressions involving only multiplications and exponentiation. Previous work gave a deterministic O(n log(2) n) time and O(n) space algorithm for the problem (n being the input size). Our specific contribution includes two randomised algorithms for the problem: (i) an O(n) time Monte Carlo algorithm (that is, with a small probability it may decide erroneously that the two types are isomorphic), and (ii) an 0(n log n) expected time and 0(n) space Las Vegas algorithm (that is, with a small probability it may execute long). The algorithms rely on a preprocessing stage, which computes the sequence of the first n primes in O(n log n/log log n) time and space.", "paper_title": "Randomised algorithms for isomorphisms of simple types", "paper_id": "WOS:000248779300007"}
