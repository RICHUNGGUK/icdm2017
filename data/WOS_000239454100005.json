To this aim we give algebraic characterizations for the language operations of generating the polynomial closure and generating the unambiguous polynomial closure over traces. We also show that there exist natural fragments of local temporal logic that describe this class of languages corresponding to DA. All characterizations are known to hold for words.", "paper_title": "Polynomials, fragments of temporal logic and the variety DA over traces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454100005"}
