It is noticeable that the efficiency of KPCA-based feature extraction is in inverse proportion to the size of the training sample set. In order to speed up KPCA-based feature extraction, we develop a novel algorithm(i.e. IKPCA) which improves KPCA with a distinctive viewpoint. The algorithm is methodologically consistent with KPCA with clear physical meaning. Experiments on several benchmark datasets illustrate that IKPCA-based feature extraction is much faster than KPCA-based feature extraction. The ratio of IKPCA-based feature extraction time to KPCA-based feature extraction time may be smaller than 0.30. Furthermore, the classification accuracy corresponding to IKPCA is comparable with KPCA.", "paper_title": "Efficient KPCA-based feature extraction: A novel algorithm and experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300023"}
