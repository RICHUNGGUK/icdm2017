Despite the importance of this problem, previous research on the subject is very limited. At present, no generally accepted design or analysis method is available to evaluate the stability of tunnels/openings in cohesive-frictional soils. In this study. continuous loading is applied to the ground surface, and both smooth and rough interface conditions are modelled. For a series of tunnel diameter-to-depth ratios and material properties, rigorous lower- and upper-bound solutions for the ultimate surcharge loading are obtained by applying finite element limit analysis techniques. For practical use, the results are presented in the form of dimensionless stability charts with the actual tunnel stability numbers being closely bracketed from above and below. As an additional check on the solutions, upper-bound rigid-block mechanisms have been developed and the predicted collapse loads from these are compared with those from finite element limit analysis. Finally, an expression that approximates the ultimate surcharge load has been devised which is convenient for use by practising engineers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
