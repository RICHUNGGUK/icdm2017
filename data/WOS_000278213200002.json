Generally, the first three levels of the most capability models have the same general goal, a defined repeatable process, but may differ in their implementation of that goal. In addition, organisations are more likely to involve multiple independent parties in the development or service management processes. Organisation and control theories provide principles that support the first three levels of most capability models. However, different forms of organisational control and coordination require that the evidence used to assess achievement of the different capability levels must broaden from its current focus on activities and tasks to include work products, their characteristics and verification, and skills, competence and training.
