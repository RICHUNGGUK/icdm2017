Rough set theory is a tool for reducing redundancy in information systems, thus Application of Rough Set to gene selection is interesting. In this paper, a novel gene selection method called RMIMR is proposed for gene selection, which searches for the subset through maximum relevance and maximum positive interaction of genes. Compared with the classical methods based on statistics, information theory and regression, Our method leads to significantly improved classification in experiments on 4 gene expression datasets.", "paper_title": "Gene selection using rough set theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500113"}
