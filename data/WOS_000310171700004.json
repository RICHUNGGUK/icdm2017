Such a transition from graphs to vectors is known as graph embedding. A key issue in graph embedding is to select a proper set of features in order to make the vectorial representation of graphs as strong and discriminative as possible. In this article, we propose features that are constructed out of frequencies of node label representatives. We first build a large set of features and then select the most discriminative ones according to different ranking criteria and feature transformation algorithms. On different classification tasks, we experimentally show that only a small significant subset of these features is needed to achieve the same classification rates as competing to state-of-the-art methods.
