Each residual is robust to unknown signals and sensitive to a subset of faults. A bank of residual generators (RG), each of them having different robustness/sensitivity properties, are used to isolate the faulty component. Designing a RG is not trivial especially for nonlinear models. Generally speaking, the Fundamental Problem of Residual Generation (FPRG), may be decomposed in two steps: a model decomposition problem and a stability problem. This paper addresses the first problem using algebra of functions. Existing works using this approach are discussed and improvements on several aspects are proposed. An academic nonlinear example is provided to illustrate step by step the methodology and to the show the relevance of the proposed improvements.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear model decomposition for robust fault detection and isolation using algebraic tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000242840900012"}
