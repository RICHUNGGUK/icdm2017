The critical parameters found were particle size, diameter of spray cone at a break-up length and a spray cone angle. A range of values for each of the parameters were ascertained through imaging analysis which were then transposed into initial particle boundary conditions for particle flow simulation within the nasal cavity by using Computational Fluid Dynamics software. An Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme was utilised to track mono-dispersed particles (10 and 20 mu m) at a breathing rate of 10L/min. The results from this qualitative study aim to assist the pharmaceutical industry to improve and help guide the design of nasal spray devices. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
