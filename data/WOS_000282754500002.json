Firstly, the concept of TIFNs is introduced. Arithmetic operations and cut sets over TIFNs are investigated. Then, the values and ambiguities of the membership degree and the non-membership degree for TIFNs are defined as well as the value-index and ambiguity-index. Finally, a value and ambiguity based ranking method is developed and applied to solve multiattribute decision making problems in which the ratings of alternatives on attributes are expressed using TIFNs. A numerical example is examined to demonstrate the implementation process and applicability of the method proposed in this paper. Furthermore, comparison analysis of the proposed method is conducted to show its advantages over other similar methods.", "paper_title": "A Ranking Method of Triangular Intuitionistic Fuzzy Numbers and Application to Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000282754500002"}
