Passive traffic measurement increasingly employs sampling at the packet level and makes inferences from sampled network traffic. This paper proposes a maximum probability method that estimates the length of the corresponding original flow from the length of a sampled flow. We construct the probability models of the original flow length distributions of a sampled flow under the assumptions of various flow length distributions, respectively. Through recovery analyzing with different parameters, we obtain a consistent linear expression that reflects the relationship between the length of sampled flow and that of the corresponding original flow. Furthermore, after using publicly available traces and traces collected from CERNET to do recovery experiments and comparing the experiment outcomes and theoretic values calculated with Pareto distributions, we may conclude that the maximum probability method calculated by using the Pareto distribution with 1.0 can be used to estimate original flow length in the concerned network.", "paper_title": "Estimating original flow length from sampled flow statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500016"}
