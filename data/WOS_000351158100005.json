In our main result, we demonstrate a random self-reducibility property for . Along the way, we also prove a sequence of lemmas regarding homomorphisms of free Burnside groups of exponent 3 that may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "Hardness of learning problems over Burnside groups of exponent 3", "paper_id": "WOS:000351158100005"}
