We consider all possible arrangements of the two circular cylinders in terms of the distance between the two cylinders and the inclination angle of the line connecting the cylinder centers with respect to the direction of the main flow. It turns out that significant changes in the characteristics of flow-induced forces are noticed depending on how the two circular cylinders are positioned, resulting ill quantitative changes of force coefficients on both cylinders. Collecting all the numerical results obtained, we propose contour diagrams for mean force coefficients and rms values of force coefficient fluctuations for each of the two cylinders. The perfect geometrical symmetry implied in the flow configuration allows one to use those diagrams to estimate flow-induced forces oil two circular cylinders of equal diameter arbitrarily positioned in physical space with respect to the main flow direction.
