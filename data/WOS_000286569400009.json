The study aims to directly adopt incomplete measured mode shapes in structural damage identification and effectively reduce the influence of measurement errors on predictions of structural damage. Design/methodology/approach - Damage indicators are properly chosen to reflect both the location and severity of damage in framed buildings at element level for braces and at critical point level for beams and columns. Basic equations for an iterative solution procedure are provided to be solved for the chosen damage indicators. The Tikhonov regularisation method incorporating the L-curve criterion for determining the regularisation parameter is employed to produce stable and robust solutions for damage indicators. Findings - The proposed method can correctly assess the quantification of structural damage at specific locations in complex framed buildings using only limited information on modal data measurements with errors, without requiring mode shape expansion techniques or model reduction processes. Research limitations/implications - Further work may be needed to improve the accuracy of inverse predictions for very small structural damage from noisy measurements. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for the development of reliable techniques for rapid and on-line damage assessment and health monitoring of framed buildings. Originality/value - The paper offers a practical approach and procedure for correctly detecting structural damage and assessing structural condition from limited noisy vibration measurements.", "paper_title": "Identification of structural damage in buildings using iterative procedure and regularisation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000286569400009"}
