It is known that every planar graph G of n vertices has a grid drawing on an (n-2)x(n-2) or (4n/3)x(2n/3) integer grid. In this paper we show that if a planar graph G has a balanced partition then G has a grid drawing with small grid area. More precisely, if a separation pair bipartitions G into two edge-disjoint subgraphs G (1) and G (2), then G has a max {n (1),n (2)}xmax {n (1),n (2)} grid drawing, where n (1) and n (2) are the numbers of vertices in G (1) and G (2), respectively. In particular, we show that every series-parallel graph G has a (2n/3)x(2n/3) grid drawing and a grid drawing with area smaller than 0.3941n (2) (<(2/3)(2) n (2)).", "paper_title": "Small grid drawings of planar graphs with balanced partition", "paper_id": "WOS:000305748300003"}
