We compared the diagnostic efficacy of non-informed observers and informed observers regarding the CAD system's ability (average FP (false positive) per four images and sensitivity of microcalcifications and mass) to detect cancer. With the informed-group, we previously informed them of the accuracy of CAD. In each group, observers recorded the diagnosis before utilizing the CAD system and after utilizing the CAD system according to BI-RADs category and to six additional categories associated with diagnostic confidence. Regarding diagnostic accuracy, with the informed group, sensitivity and NPV were improved without an increase in FP. On the other hand, the diagnostic accuracy of human observers was influenced by prior notification of CAD's accuracy and by CAD's performance in cancer detection itself.", "paper_title": "The impact of integration of computer-aided detection and human observers", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900015"}
