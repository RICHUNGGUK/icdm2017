It has been devised as a benchmark case to test the quality of boundary conditions in numerical solvers for computational fluid dynamics. In this experiment, a two-dimensional system of two counter-rotating vertexes is brought into collision with a no-slip wall and rebounds from it. In the present paper, the benchmark is run with a lattice-Boltzmann numerical solver. Astonishingly accurate results are obtained with a straightforward boundary condition known under the name of bounce-back. This sample problem is also used to discuss techniques for the setup of an initial condition in the lattice Boltzmann method.", "paper_title": "A benchmark case for lattice Boltzmann: Turbulent dipole-wall collision", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000023"}
