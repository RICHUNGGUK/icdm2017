The system uses ST-Guide which models a guideline as a set of states and transitions. The audit system tries to find a path in the state/transition diagram that corresponds to the actions taken by the physician, taking into consideration issues such as the unavailability of all the data needed to evaluate the transitions. The system was used to audit an outpatient clinic regarding their procedure for hypertension treatment (using the VI JNC guideline for hypertension), and the results of the number of non-compliant actions were presented and discussed. A follow up auditing showed a small but statistically significant reduction on the number of non-compliant actions for patients treated after the first audit.", "paper_title": "ST-Audit: guideline-based automatic auditing of electronic patient records", "paper_id": "WOS:000286570600003"}
