Layer 2 triggers such as the signal strength is used to trigger in advance scanning phases, in which a mobile device probes the adjacent access points. This scanning phase is performed alternatively with communication. Sufficient Layer 3 information is conveyed in Layer 2 frames, which allows a mobile device to identify both its next Layer 2 and Layer 3 point of attachment. Simulation results show that this method performs well and enhance both the Layer 2 and the Layer 3 handover. The impact of handovers on real-time application is also considerably minimized.
