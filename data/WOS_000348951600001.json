Specifically, we impose the additional requirement that each connected component of a solution have at least t vertices (resp. edges from the solution) for a fixed positive integer t, and call the problem t-TOTAL VERTEX COVER (resp. t-TOTAL EDGE COVER). In both cases the parameter k is the size of the solution. We show that both problems remain fixed-parameter tractable with these restrictions, with running times of the form O*(c(k)) for some constant c > 0 in each case, where the O* notation hides polynomial factors; for each fixed t >= 2, t-TOTAL VERTEX COVER has no polynomial kernel unless CoNP subset of NP/poly; for each fixed t >= 2, t-TOTAL EDGE COVER has a linear vertex kernel of size t + 1/t k. These results significantly improve earlier work on these problems. We illustrate the utility of the technique used to solve t-TOTAL VERTEX COVER, by applying it to derive an O*(c(k))-time FPT algorithm for the t-TOTAL EDGE DOMINATING SET problem. Our no-poly-kernel result for t-TOTAL VERTEX COVER, and the known NP-hardness result for t-TOTAL EDGE COVER, are in stark contrast to the fact that VERTEX COVER has a 2k vertex kernel, and that EDGE COVER is solvable in polynomial time. This illustrates how even the slightest connectivity requirement results in a drastic change in the tractability of problems-the curse of connectivity! (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
