Global clock network, especially in nanometer CMOS designs with ever increasing die sizes, has become a prominent performance limiter. A potential alternative to traditional interconnect technology for achieving clock distribution beyond 10 GHz while maintaining required skew and jitter budgets is using on-chip optical interconnects. A practical on-chip optical clocking system must be CMOS compatible in order to provide attractive cost effectiveness for system level integration and ease of manufacturing. This paper presents the design of a fully CMOS compatible optical clock distribution and recovery system in a 3.3 V, 0.35-mu m CMOS process. Experimental results' from the test chip prove the feasibility of providing optical-electrical interface in devices and circuits in a fully CMOS compatible manufacturing environment. Although the test chips were designed in a mature CMOS process technology and the measured performance is low, the test chips demonstrated the feasibility of on-chip optoelectronic integration with fully CMOS compatible process. On-chip optical clock distribution is one of the natural applications of fully CMOS compatible on-chip optical interconnect technology.", "paper_title": "Fully CMOS-Compatible On-Chip Optical Clock Distribution and Recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000282843300001"}
