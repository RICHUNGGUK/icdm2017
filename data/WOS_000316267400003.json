The proposed scheme can protect distribution and feeder fiber simultaneously. Two different frequency bands are used in this proposed system for paratactic OFDM-PON. The disrupt signals can be restored via the fiber links of the neighboring OFDM-PON without special protecting fibers. We analytically and experimentally study the receiver sensitivity to downstream 10 Gb/s OFDM signals and upstream 2.5 Gb/s NRZ signals. The proposed architecture is designed mainly for next-generation PON systems.", "paper_title": "A novel self-surviving architecture for next-generation OFDM passive optical network supporting colorless ONUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000316267400003"}
