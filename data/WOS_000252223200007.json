Its blocks can be arranged into an m x (km - 1) array in such a way that (1) every element of V is contained in exactly one cell of each column, and (2) every element of V is contained in at most k cells of each row. In this paper, we present a new construction for GBTDs and show that a GBTD(4, m) exists for any integer m >= 5 with at most eight possible exceptions. A link between a GBTD(k, m) and a near constant composition code is also mentioned. The derived code is optimal in the sense of its size.", "paper_title": "Generalized balanced tournament designs and related codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000252223200007"}
