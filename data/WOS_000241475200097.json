Pagerank was used in systems based on hyperlink structure such as Google. It was necessary to develop a technique combining the advantages of two systems. In this paper, we drew up a framework by using the content of web pages and the out-link information synchronously. We set up a matrix M, which composed of out-link information and the relevant value of web pages with the given query. The relevant value was denoted by TFIDF. We got the New-PR (New Pagerank) by solving the equation with the coefficient M. Experimental results showed that more pages, which were more important both in content and hyper-link sides, were selected.", "paper_title": "New PR-combining TFIDF with Pagerank", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200097"}
