Cloud computing environments have led to research in the areas of data processing, virtual environments, and access control. Information security is the most important research area for these environments security. In this study, we analyzed typical example of network testbeds, which have been used for malicious activity data collection and its subsequent analysis. Further, we propose an effective malicious network application testbed, which is based on a cloud system. We also verified the performance of our new testbed by comparing real malicious activity with the cloud-based testbed results.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach to Analyzing for Detecting Malicious Network Activity Using a Cloud Computing Testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000313800500011"}
