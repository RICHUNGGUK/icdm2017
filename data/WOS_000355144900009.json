The three-component information-energetic-structural irreducible processing in autonomous systems is the core of the proposed approach. The cybernetic organization of a general entity of life-the alivon-is postulated. The crucial properties of life and evolution are derived from the proposed approach. Information encoded in biological structures is also studied.", "paper_title": "The general entity of life: a cybernetic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000355144900009"}
