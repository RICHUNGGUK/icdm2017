This representation shows some interesting properties such as hierarchy, modularity and easy constructibility checking by definition. Together with this representation, efficient CP operators are introduced that allow efficient and fast evolution, as witnessed by the results on two construction problems that demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to achieve both compactness and reusability of evolved components.", "paper_title": "Blindbuilder: A new encoding to evolve lego-like structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227900006"}
