In this research, we develop an integrated framework for vehicle interior design using a digital human model (DHM). In this framework, the knowledge-based parametric modelling function of vehicles is implemented using a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) system. The combination of the DHM and the CAD system enables designers into carry out ergonomic evaluations of various human-vehicle interactions and understand the effects of modifications of vehicle design parameters on occupants during designing. Further, the information on human-vehicle interaction obtained using this system can be transmitted to dedicated biomechanical analysis software. By analysing human motions inside vehicles using such software, we can obtain optimized interior design parameters.", "paper_title": "Integrated Framework for Vehicle Interior Design Using Digital Human Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000271535700015"}
