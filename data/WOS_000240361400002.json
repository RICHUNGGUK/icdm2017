This work presents a new approach to door-detection in indoor environments using computer vision. Doors are found in gray-level images by detecting the borders of their architraves. A variation of the Hough Transform is used in order to extract the segments in the image after applying the Canny edge detector. Features like length, direction, or distance between segments are used by a fuzzy system to analyze whether the relationship between them reveals the existence of doors. The system has been designed to detect rectangular doors typical of many indoor environments by the use of expert knowledge. Besides, a tuning mechanism based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of the system according to the particularities of the environment in which it is going to be employed. A large database of images containing doors of our building, seen from different angles and distances, has been created to test the performance of the system before and after the tuning process. The system has shown the ability to detect rectangular doors under heavy perspective deformations and it is fast enough to be used for real-time applications in a mobile robot.", "paper_title": "Detection of doors using a genetic visual fuzzy system for mobile robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000240361400002"}
