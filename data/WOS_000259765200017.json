The Laplacian energy of G, recently introduced in the literature, is an analogous graph invariant defined as a function of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix and the average degree of G. We investigate the Laplacian energy of the graphs whose energy was studied in the paper I. Gutman and L. Pavlovic, The energy of some graphs with large number of edges, Bull. Acad. Serbe Sci. Arts (Cl. Math. Natur.) 118 (1999) 35-50.
