An improved iterated greedy heuristic with a sinking temperature is presented to minimize the maximum lateness. To verify the developed heuristic, computational experiments are conducted on a well-known benchmark problem data set. The experimental results show that the proposed heuristic outperforms the basic iterated greedy heuristic and the state-of-art algorithms on the same benchmark problem data set. It is believed that this improved approach will also be helpful for other applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
