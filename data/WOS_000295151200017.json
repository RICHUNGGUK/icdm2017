Investigation of resolving the cross-coupling problem of dual-axis platform is addressed by a neural net-based decoupling compensator and a sufficient condition ensuring closed-loop stability is derived. An evolutionary algorithm processing the universal seeking capability is proposed for finding the optimal connecting weights of the neural decoupling compensator and the gains of PID controllers. Extensive numerical studies verify the performance and applicability of the proposed design under a variety of operating conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
