This work is motivated by recent evidence from the cognitive science community demonstrating the efficacy of component-based facial representations. The component-based framework presented in this paper consists of the following major steps: 1) landmark extraction using Active Shape Models (ASM), 2) alignment and cropping of components using Procrustes Analysis, 3) representation of components with Multiscale Local Binary Patterns (MLBP), 4) per-component measurement of facial similarity, and 5) fusion of per-component similarities. We demonstrate on three public datasets and an operational dataset consisting of face images of 8000 subjects, that the proposed component-based representation provides higher recognition accuracies over holistic-based representations. Additionally, we show that the proposed component-based representations: 1) are more robust to changes in facial pose, and 2) improve recognition accuracy on occluded face images in forensic scenarios.", "paper_title": "Component-Based Representation in Automated Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000318595000021"}
