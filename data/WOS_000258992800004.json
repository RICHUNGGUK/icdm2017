Unfortunately, these goals typically contradict each other. Multi-level circuits are often quite small but can have a long delay, due to their unbounded number of levels. On the other hand, circuits with low depth guarantee low delay but are often larger regarding the area requirements. A different optimization goal is good testability which can usually only be achieved by additional hardware overhead. In this paper we propose a synthesis technique that allows to trade-off between area and delay. Moreover, the resulting circuits are 100% testable under the stuck-at fault model. The proposed approach relies on the combination of 100% testable circuits derived from binary decision diagrams and 2-SPP networks. Full testability under the stuck-at fault model is proven and experimental results show the trade-off between area and depth. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
