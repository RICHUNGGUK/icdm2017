In contrast with the previous contribution, our focus is firstly on deriving the cumulative distribution function of the discrete random variable D over a perfect channel. One benefit of such dispose is that, from the overall viewpoint, computing the cumulative distribution function of delay D can be related with calculating the cardinalities of sets of some special matrices, so that the former can be obtained from the latter. Moreover, our expression of the probability distribution is an explicit form, and is valid for any number of packets M, freewill field size q and arbitrary channel loss rate epsilon.", "paper_title": "The Explicit Decoding Delay Probability Distribution Based on Random Linear Coding Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400035"}
