The effective range of each sensor is specified by a disk, and the robot must at least reach the boundary to start communication. The primary goal of optimization in this scenario is to minimize the traveling distance by the robot. This problem can be regarded as a special case of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods (TSPN), which is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we present a novel TSPN algorithm for this class of TSPN, which can yield significantly improved results compared to the latest approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "On the optimal robot routing problem in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000248117600008"}
