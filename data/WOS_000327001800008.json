The cost of a plane cut is the area of the intersection of the plane with Q, and the objective is to find a cutting sequence that minimizes the total cost. We present three approximation solutions to this problem: an O(n log n) time O(log(2) n)-factor approximation, an O(n(1.5) log n) time O(log n)-factor approximation, and an O(1)-factor approximation with exponential running time. Our results significantly improve upon the previous O(n(3)) time O(log(2) n)-factor approximation solution. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
