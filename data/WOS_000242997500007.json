The algorithm is an extension of Freudenthal's subdivision method. The proposed algorithm deals with the more general case of k(d) subdivision, and is considerably simpler than the RedRefinementND algorithm for implementation of Freudenthal's strategy. The proposed simplex subdivision algorithm is motivated by a problem in the field of robust control theory: the computation of a tight upper bound of a dynamical system performance index by means of a branch-and-bound algorithm.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 860: SimpleS - An extension of Freudenthal's simplex subdivision", "paper_id": "WOS:000242997500007"}
