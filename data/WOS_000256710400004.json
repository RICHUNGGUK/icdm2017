This paper aims at improving a special strategy i.e. predictive control for a special class of hybrid systems i.e. mixed logical dynamical systems. For mixed logical dynamical systems as a main class of hybrid systems, the only existing way to ensure the closed loop stability of predictive controllers is to use a terminal state equality constraint in the successive optimization problems. Limitations caused by this type of constraint have been discussed. Contractive predictive control is proposed as a good alternative which assures the closed loop stability in a more feasible manner. As a Lyapunov function, the L, norm of the state vector is enforced to shrink in successive optimization steps. A suboptimal version of contractive MPC scheme has been proposed which reduces the computational complexity of the control problem while preserving the stability.", "paper_title": "Contractive predictive control of mixed logical dynamical hybrid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400004"}
