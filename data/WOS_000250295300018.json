While improving the system's reliability, the cost is also on the upswing. The availability is increased by a redundancy system. Redundancy Allocation Problem (RAP) of a series-parallel system is traditionally resolved by experienced system designers. We proposed a genetic algorithm based optimization model to improve the design efficiency. The objective is to determine the most economical policy of components' mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) and mean time-to-repair (MTTR). We also developed a knowledge-based interactive decision support system to assist the designers set up and to store component parameters during the intact design process of repairable series-parallel system.
