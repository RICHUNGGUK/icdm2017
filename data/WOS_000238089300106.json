We explore a few methods for dynamic terrain surface, and analyze the different recent algorithms for representation and visualization of multiresolution static terrain, then select ROAM (Real-Time Optimally Adapting Meshes) as our basis to be improved and to be applicable in dynamic terrain projects. We further select half-ellipsoid model in the explosion theory as the physical based model of crater, and provide a procedural texture generation algorithm for crater, then give a hybrid multiresolution algorithm for dynamic terrain. At last the implementation results prove that the method and the algorithm are feasible and efficient.", "paper_title": "Research of dynamic terrain in complex battlefield environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300106"}
