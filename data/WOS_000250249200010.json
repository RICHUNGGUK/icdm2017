Based on the concept of completing the mth root, a detailed analysis of the convergence conditions is performed and iteration-independent digit-selection rules are obtained for any radix and redundant digit set. A radix-2 version for mth rooting is also studied, together with closed formulas for both the digit selection rules and the number of bits required to perform correct selections.", "paper_title": "A digit-by-digit algorithm for mth root extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000250249200010"}
