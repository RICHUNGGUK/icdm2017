However, computer models of the human anatomy are often very computationally demanding, thus incompatible with the constraints of such interactive simulations. In this paper, we propose a fast model of the cardiac electrophysiology based on an eikonal formulation implemented with an anisotropic fast marching method. We demonstrate the use of this model in the context of a simulator of radio-frequency ablation of cardiac arrhythmia from patient-specific medical imaging data. Indeed, this therapy can be very effective for patients but still suffers from a rather low success rate. Being able to test different ablation strategies on a patient-specific model can have a great clinical impact. In our setting, thanks to a haptic 3D user interface, the user can interactively measure the local extracellular potential, pace locally the myocardium or simulate the burning of cardiac tissue as done in radio-frequency ablation interventions.
