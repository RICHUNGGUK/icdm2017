Generally, a step-by-step hierarchical approach is adopted, in which the registration starts on a level with reduced complexity (downsampled images, global transformations), then continuing to levels with increased complexity, until the finest level is reached. In this paper, we propose two alternative multiresolution strategies for both the data and transformation models, in which different resolution levels are considered simultaneously instead of subsequently. Through combining the different strategies for data and transformation, we systematically define 3x3 multiresolution schemes, including both existing and novel methods. Experiments on 10 pairs of computed tomography lung data sets showed that the best performing strategy resulted in a reduction of the upper quartile of the mean target registration error from 2 to 1.5 mm, compared with the conventionally hierarchical multiresolution method, while achieving smoother deformations. Experiments with intersubject registration of 18 3D T1-weighted MRI brain scans confirmed that simultaneous multiresolution strategies produce more accurate registration results (median of mean overlap increased from 0.55 to 0.57) and smoother deformation fields than the traditionally hierarchical method. Evaluation of robustness indicated that the largest differences in accuracy between methods are observed for structures with a relatively large initial misalignment.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Multiresolution Strategies for Nonrigid Image Registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300027"}
