We draw our inspiration from some techniques that are mostly used in the hardware community, and we show how they could be applied to the verification of software components. We point out the benefits of synchronous languages and models to bridge the gap between both worlds.", "paper_title": "Scenario-based verification in presence of variability using a synchronous approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000325129700005"}
