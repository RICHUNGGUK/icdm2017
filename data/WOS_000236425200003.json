We further explore this similarity and analyze a fluid queue with finite buffer. We show, using a renewal approach, that the stationary distribution is expressed as a linear combination of two matrix-exponential terms. We briefly indicate how these terms may be computed in an efficient and numerically stable manner. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
