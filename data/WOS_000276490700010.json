In this proposed system discrete value signals and continuous value signals are used together and are interacting one another. The main advantage of this system is that a discrete chaotic map can be implemented in the digital circuit with many parameters, and initial condition can be set with a great accuracy. Also, the problem of periodicity which is always encountered in any fully discrete systems can be avoided. A chaotic behavior study of the system is then provided, in which bifurcation phenomena are explained and chaotic attractors are shown. Finally, an asymptotic chaotic behavior of the proposed system is derived.", "paper_title": "Chaos generator for secure transmission using a sine map and an RLC series circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000276490700010"}
