This hybrid methodology links the search and optimization capabilities of multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) with structural performance information provided by finite element reliability analysis. To highlight the strengths of the proposed methodology, a practical example is presented that concerns optimizing the topology, geometry, and member sizes of electrical transmission towers. The weight and reliability index of a tower are defined as the two objectives used by MOGA to perform Pareto ranking of tower designs. The truss deformation and the member stresses are compared to threshold values to assess the reliability of each tower under wind loading. Importance sampling is used for the reliability analysis. Both the wind pressure and the wind direction are considered as random variables in the analysis. The research results presented demonstrate the benefit of implementing MOGA optimization as an integral part of a reliability-based optimization procedure for three-dimensional trusses.", "paper_title": "Reliability-based optimal design of electrical transmission towers using multi-objective genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000244744200005"}
