These new shape functions depend on rotation speed and element position along the beam and account for the centrifugal stiffening effect. The natural frequencies predicted by the proposed element are compared with an element with stiff-string, cubic polynomial and quintic polynomial shape functions. It is found that the new element exhibits superior convergence compared to the other basis functions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
