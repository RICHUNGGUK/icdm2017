In such circumstances, the realization of WDM EPONs is the best solution for the implementation of converged triple-play networks. In this paper we present a novel algorithm dynamic wavelength priority bandwidth allocation with traffic class hopping for wavelength and bandwidth allocation with quality of service (QoS) support that incorporates both offline and modified online scheduling. In order to implement QoS support, we present an approach in which wavelength assignment takes place per service class and not per optical network unit, as suggested by the common approach in literature. The presented algorithm can guarantee both the priority and fairness of the differentiated traffic classes. Apart from the theoretical analysis, we studied and evaluated the performance of the presented model through detailed simulation experiments. An original network model is developed in MATLAB and incorporates all key parameters of the real network environment, such as queuing, transmission and packet processing delay, round-trip time, and framing overhead. The simulation results confirm the excellent performance of the presented model in terms of average packet delay, jitter, and packet loss.", "paper_title": "Highly Flexible and Efficient Model for QoS Provisioning in WDM EPON", "paper_id": "WOS:000323493600010"}
