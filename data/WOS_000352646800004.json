Unlike the stack or the tape for a storage, the multiset might seem to be less powerful in computing task, due to the lack of positional (structural) information of stored data. We introduce the class of FAMMs of degree d (for non-negative integer d) in general form, and investigate the computing powers of some subclasses of those FAMMs. We show that the classes of languages accepted by FAMMs of degree 0, by FAMMs of degree 1, by exponentially-boundedFAMMs of degree 2, and by FAMMs of degree 2 are exactly the four classes of languages REG, CF, CS and RE in the Chomsky hierarchy, respectively. Thus, this unified view from multiset-based computing provides new insight into the computational aspects of the Chomsky hierarchy.", "paper_title": "Finite Automata with Multiset Memory: A New Characterization of Chomsky Hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000352646800004"}
