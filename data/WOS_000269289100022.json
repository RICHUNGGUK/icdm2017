The blending surface is constructed with a collection of space Curves defined by point pairs on the blending boundaries of given primary surfaces. Bezier and C-cubic curves are used to interpolate the blending boundaries. The blending surface is G '' Continuously connected to the primary surfaces. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
