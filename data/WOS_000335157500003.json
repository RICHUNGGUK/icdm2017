The differential output signal is generated by the second harmonic of the nonlinear push-push pairs. In order to enhance the symmetry of the high frequency differential output, a stacked transformer implemented by the top two metal layers in 90-nm CMOS process is used as the loads in the proposed frequency doubler. Simulation results show that the proposed circuit has achieved less than phase mismatch and 0.6-dB amplitude mismatch operating at 60-GHz.", "paper_title": "A novel transformer-based mm-Wave frequency doubler with enhanced output symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000335157500003"}
