The core reduction is based on the decomposition of a graph into its triconnected components and can be computed in linear time. It has applications in heuristic and exact optimization algorithms for the planarity measures mentioned above. Experimental results show that this strategy yields a reduction to 2/3 in average for a widely used benchmark set of graphs.", "paper_title": "Non-planar core reduction of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300021"}
