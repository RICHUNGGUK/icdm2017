And, the relationship between the algebraic immunity of a multi-output Boolean function and those of its component functions is studied. We show that all the component functions, together with their nonzero linear combination, of the multi-output Boolean functions achieved by this construction have optimal algebraic immunity simultaneously.", "paper_title": "On the construction of multi-output Boolean functions with optimal algebraic immunity", "paper_id": "WOS:000305330600012"}
