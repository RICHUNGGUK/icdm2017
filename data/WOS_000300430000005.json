The first technique is a non-conforming mesh refinement approach based on the fictitious domain method (FDM), and the second one is the extended finite element method (XFEM). The refinement technique uses one fixed reference mesh, and to impose continuity across non-conforming regions, constraints using Lagrangian multipliers are used. The size of elements locally in the high shear rate regions is reduced to increase accuracy. FDM is shown to have limitations; therefore, XFEM is applied to decouple the fluid from the internal moving rigid bodies. In XFEM, the discontinuous field variables are captured by using virtual degrees of freedom that serve as enrichment and by applying special integration over the intersected elements. The accuracy of the two methods is demonstrated by direct comparison with results of a boundary-fitted mesh applied to a two-dimensional cross section of a twin-screw extruder. Compared with non-conforming FDM, XFEM shows a considerable improvement in accuracy around the rigid body, especially in the narrow gap regions.
