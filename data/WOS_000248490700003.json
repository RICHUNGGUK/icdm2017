[Y.-C. Chen, J.J.M. Tan, L.-H. Hsu, S.-S. Kao, Super-connectivity and super edge-connectivity for some interconnection networks, Applied Mathematics and Computation 140 (2003) 245-254]. As applications of the results, we obtain that the 2-extraconnectivities of several well-known interconnection networks, such as hypercubes, twisted cubes, crossed cubes, Mobius cubes and locally twisted cubes, are all equal to 3n - 5 when their dimension n is not less than 8. That is, when n >= 8, at least 3n - 5 vertices must be removed to disconnect any one of these n-dimensional networks provided that the removal of these vertices does not isolate a vertex or an edge.
