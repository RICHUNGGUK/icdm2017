To design the PID controller, a reduced order model is introduced, whose linear parameters are identified by a normalized projection algorithm with a deadzone. The higher order nonlinearity is estimated by a high order neural network. The gains of the PID controller are obtained by pole assignment, which together with other parameters are tuned on-line. The bounded-input bounded-output stability condition and convergence condition of the closed-loop system are presented. Simulations are conducted on the continuous stirred tank reactors system. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Self-Tuning Control With a Filter and a Neural Compensator for a Class of Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316494700014"}
