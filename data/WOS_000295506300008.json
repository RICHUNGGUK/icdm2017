The objective function depends on the pulse envelope, which is extracted by utilizing the Hilbert transform. The gradients with respect to the topology optimization variables are derived, and the optimization methodology is demonstrated for pulse delaying and pulse splitting. The formulation is applicable for nonlinear structures and signals consisting of broad range of frequencies.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of pulse shaping filters using the Hilbert transform envelope extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000295506300008"}
