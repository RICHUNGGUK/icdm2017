Current algorithms for inference convert a BN to a junction tree structure made up of clusters of the BN nodes and the resulting complexity is time exponential in the size of a cluster. The need to reduce the complexity is especially acute where the BN contains continuous nodes. We propose a new method for optimizing the calculation of Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) involving continuous nodes, approximated in Hybrid Bayesian Networks (HBNs), using an approximation algorithm called dynamic discretization. We present an optimized solution to this problem involving binary factorization of the arithmetical expressions declared to generate the CPTs for continuous nodes for deterministic functions and statistical distributions. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested in a commercial Hybrid Bayesian Network software package and the results of the empirical evaluation show significant performance improvement over unfactorized models.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the Calculation of Conditional Probability Tables in Hybrid Bayesian Networks Using Binary Factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000304202000011"}
