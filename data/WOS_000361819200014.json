Aiming to detect heads with arbitrarily occluded faces and head pose, in this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian energy function based algorithm for elliptical head contour detection. Starting with the localization of head and shoulder by an improved Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approach, the precise head contour is obtained by making use of the Omega shape formed from the head and shoulder. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed idea over the state-of-the-art in both detection accuracy and processing speed, even though there are various types of severe occlusions in faces.", "paper_title": "Fast and robust head detection with arbitrary pose and occlusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000361819200014"}
