In this paper we present our framework for the formalization of mathematical knowledge that can produce machine verifiable proofs (for different proof assistants) but also human-readable (nearly textbook-like) proofs. As a case study, we focus on one of the twentieth century classics - a book on Tarski's geometry. We tried to automatically generate such proofs for the theorems from this book using resolution theorem provers and a coherent logic theorem prover. In the first experiment, we used only theorems from the book, in the second we used additional lemmas from the existing Coq formalization of the book, and in the third we used specific dependency lists from the Coq formalization for each theorem. The results show that 37 % of the theorems from the book can be automatically proven (with readable and machine verifiable proofs generated) without any guidance, and with additional lemmas this percentage rises to 42 %. These results give hope that the described framework and other forms of automation can significantly aid mathematicians in developing formal and informal mathematical knowledge.", "paper_title": "Automated generation of machine verifiable and readable proofs: A case study of Tarski's geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000357420500001"}
