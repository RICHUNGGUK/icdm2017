This allows SARAH to create model files for FeynArts/FormCalc, CalcHep/CompHep and WHIZARD/D'Mega. The newest version of SARAH now provides the possibility to create model files in the UFO format which is supported by MadGraph 5, MadAnalysis 5, GoSam, and soon by Herwig++. Furthermore, SARAH also calculates the mass matrices, RGEs and 1-loop corrections to the mas spectrum. This information is used to write source code for SPheno in order to create a precision spectrum generator for the given model. This spectrum-generator generator functionality as well as the output of WHIZARD and CalcHep model files has seen further improvement in this version. Also models including Dirac gauginos are supported with the new version of SARAH, and additional checks for the consistency of the implementation of new models have been created.", "paper_title": "SARAH 3.2: Dirac gauginos, UFO output, and more", "paper_id": "WOS:000318194000015"}
