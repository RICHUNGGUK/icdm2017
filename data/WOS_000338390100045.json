The measurements transmitted from the plant to the observer and the controller are assumed to be imperfect, and two stochastic variables are utilized to model the missing data separately. A composite disturbance observer-based control and H infinity control scheme is proposed for attenuating and rejecting the disturbances. This method is focused on the design of a new structure for the disturbance observer, dynamic output feedback controller, and composite controller, such that the composite system is stochastically stable and it satisfies scheduled performance requirements. The computation-oriented conditions of the disturbance observer gains and controller matrices for the controlled plant are provided based on the piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functional approach. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the utility and applicability of the proposed theoretical method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
