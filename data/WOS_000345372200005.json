The adaptive weight coefficient of the cost function based on the final motor task error (i.e. distance between end-effector and target at the end of movement) was used to correct motor task error and physiological measurements (e.g. joint power, centre of mass displacement, etc.). The output of the simulation models using various cost functions were compared to experimental data from 15 healthy participants performing full-body upright reaching movements. The proposed method can reasonably predict full-body voluntary movements in terms of final posture, joint power, and movement of the centre of mass (COM) using simple algebraic calculations of inverse dynamics and forward kinematics instead of the complicated integrals of the forward dynamics. We found that the combination of several control strategies, i.e. minimising end-effector error, total joint power and body COM produced the best fit of the full-body reaching task.", "paper_title": "An optimisation-based model for full-body upright reaching movements", "paper_id": "WOS:000345372200005"}
