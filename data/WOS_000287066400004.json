By incorporating direct adaptive interval type-2 FNN control scheme and sliding mode approach, two non-identical chaotic systems can be synchronized based on Lyapunov stability criterion. Moreover, the chattering phenomena of the control efforts can be reduced and the external disturbance on the synchronization error can be attenuated. The stability of the proposed overall adaptive control scheme will be guaranteed in the sense that all the states and signals are uniformly bounded. From the simulation example, to synchronize two non-identical Chua's chaotic circuits, it has been shown that type-2 FNN controllers have the potential to overcome the limitations of tpe-1 FNN controllers when training data is corrupted by high levels of uncertainty.
