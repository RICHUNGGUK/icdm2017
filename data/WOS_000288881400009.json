The shuffled frog leaping algorithm is utilized to find out the optimal embedding position and adaptive quantization step for embedding watermark into a carrier image in the framework of QIM. A carefully chosen fitness function is designed in terms of the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the Normalized Correlation (NR) value to achieve high transparency and robustness. The proposed scheme is blind. Compared with other quantization index related watermarking methods, SFLA-QIM exhibits satisfactory robustness against a wide variety of attacks such as amplitude scaling, filtering, noise addition, cropping and JPEG compression.", "paper_title": "A NEW ROBUST WATERMARKING SCHEME BASED ON SHUFFLED FROG LEAPING ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000288881400009"}
