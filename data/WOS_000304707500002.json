Subsampling is firstly used to construct a subimage sequence as a video segment. Then, a random watermark sequence satisfied with Gaussian distribution is block-wised embedded into the DWT domain of these subimages repeatedly using the video watermarking technique. And watermark is detected through computing correlation between watermark and watermarked frames. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves good robustness against JPEG compression, common image processing operation and geometric distortions. Furthermore, the proposed watermarking scheme is also robust against linear collusion and other video watermarking attacks.", "paper_title": "Novel robust image watermarking based on subsampling and DWT", "paper_id": "WOS:000304707500002"}
