One virtue of our approach is that the measurement of the intrathoracic volume has no time difference and is not affected by postoperative pain, which cannot be achieved with a 2-year difference between pre- and postoperative pulmonary function testing or any other clinical method. The calculations show that the intrathoracic volume of pectus excavatum patients increased by approximately 2.72-8.88% after the Nuss procedure. The increment curve was patient-dependent, although the increment behavior was similar among the six patients examined. The curve of the increase became flat when the elevating force exceeded 80 N or the displacement of the lower sternal end exceeded 2.6 cm in half of our cases.", "paper_title": "Increase in intrathoracic volume in pectus excavatum patients after the Nuss procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000273684700004"}
