In this paper, we analyze some important parameters in a typical inverter, and then design a pulse-output genetic circuit of breast cancer signal communication and monitor of breast cancer signal. We first design a single-index monitor circuit. When a certain tumor marker's concentration exceeds the positive criterion, the circuit will output a pulse as a warning. Since the diagnose results derived from one single tumor marker are sometimes indeterminate, an integrated circuit is proposed to construct a multi-index monitor circuit network. The multi-index detection can strongly increase the correct recognition rate in terms of accuracy and safety. This circuit network may also be used in other fields of gene diagnosis with some modifications, and some experiments designed to validate them had been done.", "paper_title": "Communication and monitor of breast cancer signal in the pulse-output genetic circuit network", "paper_id": "WOS:000332351000005"}
