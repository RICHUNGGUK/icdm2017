Significant work has been done on developing knowledge sources that could support these tasks, but these resources usually suffer from low coverage, noise, and are inflexible when dealing with ambiguous and general terms that may not appear in any stationary resource, making their use as general purpose background knowledge resources difficult. In this paper, rather than building a hierarchical structure of concepts and relations, we describe an algorithmic approach that, given two terms, determines the taxonomic relation between them using a machine learning-based approach that makes use of existing resources. Moreover, we develop a global constraint-based inference process that leverages an existing knowledge base to enforce relational constraints among terms and thus improves the classifier predictions. Our experimental evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms other systems built upon the existing well-known knowledge sources.", "paper_title": "Exploiting the Wikipedia structure in local and global classification of taxonomic relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000307466600005"}
