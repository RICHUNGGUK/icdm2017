We consider the TSP as a problem formulation for the multi-goal path planning problem in which paths among obstacles have to be found. We apply a simple approximation of the shortest path that seems to be suitable for the SUM adaptation procedure. The approximation is based on a geometrical interpretation of SUM, where weights of neurons represent nodes that are placed in the polygonal domain. The approximation is verified in a set of real problems and experimental results show feasibility of the proposed approach for the SUM based solution of the non-Euclidean TSP. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
