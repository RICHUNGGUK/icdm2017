Based on earlier obtained relations between cosine and other similarity measures (e.g., Jaccard index), we can prove new relations between the association strength and these other measures.", "paper_title": "On the Relation Between the Association Strength and Other Similarity Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000279151600014"}
