J. Numer Meth. Fluids 2006; 51:659-672) semi-implicit method for treating surface tension, for finite Volume models of interfacial flows. Using this method, the surface tension timestep restriction, which is often very stringent, can be exceeded by at least a factor of 5 without destabilizing the Solution. The surface tension force in this method consists of an explicit part, which is the regular continuum Surface force, and an implicit part which represents the diffusion of velocities induced by surface tension on fluids interfaces. The surface tension force is applied to the velocity field by solving a system of equations iteratively. Since the equations are solved only near interfaces, the computational time spent on the iterative procedure is insignificant.
