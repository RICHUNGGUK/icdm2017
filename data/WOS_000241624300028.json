In this paper, we propose a weblog-based approach to modeling users during collaborative learning process. Thereby, we formulate user behaviors on blogosphere, e.g., posting articles, linking to neighbors, and interactions between neighbors. These user models are capable of being compared with others to quantify similarities between users. We apply co-occurrence analysis methods. In this study, we deploy BlogGrid platform to support information pushing service to students. Through our experimental results, we found out that average weighting measurement scheme with co-occurrence patterns from responding (e.g., comments and trackback) activities is the most significant patterns for information pushing on collaborative learning.", "paper_title": "Collaborative user tracking for community organization on blogosphere: A case study of eLearning@BlogGrid", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300028"}
