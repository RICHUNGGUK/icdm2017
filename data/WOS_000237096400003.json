A linear programming formulation is introduced based on a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model that propagates traffic according to the cell transmission model. The introduced approach is limited to continuous link improvements and does not provide for new link additions. The main contribution of the article is to provide an analytical formulation for network design that accounts for DTA conditions that can be used for further analysis and extensions. The model is tested on a single destination example network, resembling a freeway corridor, for various congestion levels, loading patterns and budget sizes, to demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "A linear model for the continuous network design problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000237096400003"}
