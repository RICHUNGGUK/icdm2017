In the proposed algorithm, the incremental and decremental procedures are performed alternatively, and a small scale working set, which can cover most of the information in the training set and overcome the drawback of losing the sparseness in least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), can be formed adaptively. The classifier can be constructed by using this working set. In general, the number of the elements in the working set is much smaller than that in the training set. Therefore the proposed algorithm can be used not only to train the data sets quickly but also to test them effectively with losing little accuracy. In order to examine the training speed and the generalization performance of the proposed algoorithm. we apply both ASVM and LS-SVM to seven UCI datasets and a benchmark problem. Experimental results show that the novel algorithm is very faster than LS-SVM and loses little accuracy in solving large classification problems.", "paper_title": "An adaptive support vector machine learning algorithm for large classification problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000144"}
