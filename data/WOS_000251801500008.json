For sufficiently large constraint lengths nu, the distances are shown to grow linearly with v and the ratio d(L)/nu approaches the ratio d(free)/nu for large L. Moreover, the ratio of free distance to constraint length is several times larger than the ratio of minimum distance to block length for Gallager's ensemble of (J, K) -regular LDPC block codes.", "paper_title": "Distance bounds for an ensemble of LDPC convolutional codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000251801500008"}
