The index G is adopted to analyze the degree of color washout through simulation. By using linearly and circularly polarized incident light, the optimized regime of the area and applied voltage ratios of sub-pixels is obtained. In the experiments with the circularly polarized light, the images are sensuously improved in a coupled capacity type LCD by applying the simulated applied voltage ratio of two sub-pixels.
