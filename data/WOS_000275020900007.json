New storage-, latency-, and bandwidth-efficient mechanisms for storing metadata off chip yield a practical design that achieves 90 percent of the performance potential of idealized on-chip metadata storage.", "paper_title": "MAKING ADDRESS-CORRELATED PREFETCHING PRACTICAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000275020900007"}
