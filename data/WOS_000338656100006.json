By using the sieve method of combinatorics, we investigate the -error linear complexity distribution of -periodic binary sequences in this paper based on Games-Chan algorithm. First, for , the complete counting functions for the -error linear complexity of -periodic binary sequences (with linear complexity less than ) are characterized. Second, for , the complete counting functions for the -error linear complexity of -periodic binary sequences with linear complexity are presented.
