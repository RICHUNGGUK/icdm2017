Extending this scheme, we introduce the new concept of an electronic checkbook to meet some practical requirements in e-check applications. First, it allows the payer to attach the desired face value and the payee's account number to the e-check and utilizes a signed e-checkbook to reduce the bank's computation overhead. Second, the new scheme benefits from overcoming problems in the prior scheme: (1) high computation cost of generating digital signatures for the bank; (2) inconvenience caused by a bank's repeated request for a single electronic check for its customers; and (3) maintenance of storage for a set of electronic checks. The security analysis and the advantages examined show that the new scheme works.", "paper_title": "A PRACTICAL AND EFFICIENT ELECTRONIC CHECKBOOK", "paper_id": "WOS:000274736300003"}
