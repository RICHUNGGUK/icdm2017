Over the last years, a wide range of graph and model transformation tools have been developed all of them with their own particular strengths and typical application domains. In this paper, we give a survey and a comparison of the model and graph transformation tools that participated at the Transformation Tool Contest 2011. The reader gains an overview of the field and its tools, based on the illustrative solutions submitted to a Hello World task, and a comparison alongside a detailed taxonomy. The article is of interest to researchers in the field of model and graph transformation, as well as to software engineers with a transformation task at hand who have to choose a tool fitting to their needs. All solutions referenced in this article provide a SHARE demo. It supported the peer-review process for the contest, and now allows the reader to test the tools online.", "paper_title": "A survey and comparison of transformation tools based on the transformation tool contest", "paper_id": "WOS:000350618600003"}
