The framework consists of three major components: the Web ontology language (OWL)-description logic (DL)-based biological domain ontology, OWL Web service ontology (OWL-S)-based service annotation, and semantic matchmaker based on the ontology reasoning. Built upon the framework, workflow technologies are extensively exploited in the SIMDAT to assist biologists in (semi)automatically performing in silico experiments. We present a typical usage scenario through the case study of a biological workflow: IXodus.", "paper_title": "Semantics-enabled service discovery framework in the SIMDAT pharma grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000253840600007"}
