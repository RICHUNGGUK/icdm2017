Research in this area focuses on increasing scalability by minimizing the amount of data reaching the receiver. Current proposals for secure many-to-one transmission use costly cryptographic operations. In this paper, we present a novel system for secure many-to-one symbol transmission in which nodes are only required to perform lightweight operations. This makes it suitable for implementation in resource-constrained scenarios such as sensor networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
