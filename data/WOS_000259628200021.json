The proposed approach separates the motions into different scales or frequencies, and the dynamic feature spaces are analyzed in modeling and then mapped to a global coordinate system to expose the multi-scale structures. Our approach emphasizes the importance of fine-scale data appearing more informative, While coarse signals are less focused. The synthesized dynamic textures using our MPS approach are strongly entranced in dynamic appearance than the single-scale LDS model, and also flexible in manipulating the decomposed feature spaces for creating different dynamic textures of the real world. Our experimental results showed the more faithful synthesized dynamic textures from input short videos, and their manipulative controls by simple editing of feature space basis, not only the whole video data.
