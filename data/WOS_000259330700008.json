One downside of multimedia databases is the necessity to process the data for feature extraction and labeling prior to storage and querying. Huge amount of data makes it impossible to complete this task manually. We propose a toot for the automatic detection and tracking of salient objects, and derivation of spatio-temporal relations between them in video. Our system aims to reduce the work for manual selection and labeling of objects significantly by detecting and tracking the salient objects, and hence, requiring to enter the label for each object only once within each shot instead of specifying the labels for each object in every frame they appear. This is also required as a first step in a fully-automatic video database management system in which the labeling should also be done automatically. The proposed framework covers a scalable architecture for video processing and stages of shot boundary detection, salient object detection and tracking, and knowledge-base construction for effective spatio-temporal object querying.
