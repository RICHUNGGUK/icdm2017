In this context, many types of noises occur due to sensors problems, change of illumination, fog, rain, and other weather conditions. These noises usually degrade the digital images acquired by camera sensors. Image denoising in spatial domain is more difficult and time-consuming for real-time processing of WMSNs applications. In this study, an efficient method based on Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform(DT-CWT) is developed to enhance the image denosing in WMSNs. This method is designed to reduce the image noises by selecting an optimal threshold value estimated from the approximation of wavelet coefficients. In our experiment, the proposed method was tested and compared with standard Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) on a set of natural scene images. Better results were achieved by using the DT-CWT in terms of image quality metrics and processing time.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Image Denoising Method for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks Based on DT-CWT", "paper_id": "WOS:000365212500001"}
