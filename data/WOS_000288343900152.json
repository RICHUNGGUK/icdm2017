This study surveys 236 international travelers who have had a different experience of purchasing airline tickets from 30 different airline service websites in Taiwan. The results illustrate that perceived trust and usefulness, which are the factors of the technology acceptance perspective, positively moderate the relationship between e-service quality, perceived service value, and service satisfaction.
