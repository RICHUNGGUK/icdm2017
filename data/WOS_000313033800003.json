The optimal parameters of the proposed plan are determined when two points on operating characteristics curve namely acceptable quality level and limiting quality level and the number of testers are specified. We also considered the Burr-type XII distribution to find the plan parameters. Several tables are given for practical use. We compare the results of proposed plan with the existing plans. Results are explained using real-world examples.", "paper_title": "Optimal designing of skip-lot sampling plan of type SkSP-2 with group acceptance sampling plan as reference plan under Burr-type XII distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000313033800003"}
