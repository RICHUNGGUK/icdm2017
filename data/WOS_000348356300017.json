Line recognition is defined by multifarious forms and characteristics of lines, and has been a fundamental key point in expressing shape of 3D polygon model in non-photorealistic rendering technique. Line recognition, however, requires a long period of calculation time and thus, various methods have been studied to accelerate the speed of the operation. This paper presents a new method that will accelerate the overall operation compared to the standard CPU-based method of extracting ink line. The new method will enhance the efficiency of the calculation speed by applying the parallel processing technique CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) to the complex processes that consume a lot of time such as implicit surface calculation and feature point extraction. The overall performance will be tested and verified through various types of experiments with 3D polygon model.", "paper_title": "Line recognition algorithm for 3D polygonal model using a parallel computing platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000348356300017"}
