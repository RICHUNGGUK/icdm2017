It reduces computing intersection curves of two canal surfaces to computing intersection curves of two revolute quadrics. Furthermore, Bounding Cylinder Clipping is proposed for efficient intersection determination. Compared to the existing method, our method can (i) run more robustly and efficiently; (ii) represent the final intersection curves as a piecewise closed-form RQIC; and (iii) give a simple shape analysis.", "paper_title": "Robustly computing intersection curves of two canal surfaces with quadric decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400045"}
