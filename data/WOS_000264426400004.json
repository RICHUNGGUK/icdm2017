In this work. WNN is implemented with a feed-forward one-hidden layer architecture, whose activation functions in its hidden layer neurons are wavelet functions, in our case, the first derivative of a Gaussian function. The network training is performed using a backpropagation algorithm, adjusting the connection weights along with the network parameters. This principle is applied to the simultaneous quantification of heavy metals present in liquid media. taking the cyclic voltammogram obtained with a modified epoxy-graphite composite sensor as departure information. The combination between processing tools and electrochemical sensors is already known as an electronic tongue.", "paper_title": "WAVELET NEURAL NETWORK AS A MULTIVARIATE CALIBRATION METHOD IN VOLTAMMETRIC ELECTRONIC TONGUES", "paper_id": "WOS:000264426400004"}
