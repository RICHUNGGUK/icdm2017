The focus is on the complexity of finding and counting preimages and ancestors that are minimal with respect to cardinality. It turns out that the problems concerning gardens of Eden seem to require the presence of an NP-oracle to be solved. All the problems studied are intractable, with a complexity that ranges form FPNP[log n] to FPSPACE(poly). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
