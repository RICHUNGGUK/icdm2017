We provide a taxonomy of search problems that highlights the differences resulting from varying assumptions on the searchers, targets, and the environment. We then list a number of fundamental results in the areas of pursuit-evasion and probabilistic search, and we discuss field implementations on mobile robotic systems. In addition, we highlight current open problems in the area and explore avenues for future work.", "paper_title": "Search and pursuit-evasion in mobile robotics A survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000298632900002"}
