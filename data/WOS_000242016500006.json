The advantage of using ACO lies in the fact that the discrete spaces can be optimized with no complexity. The algorithm selects the optimum cross-sections from the available sections list. Elastic behavior is assumed for the formulation of the problem. In addition to strength constraints, the displacement constraints are considered for design. Here, the displacement method is used for analysis employing a special 3-node beam known as a uniplet. Two design examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of scissor-link foldable structures using Ant Colony Optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242016500006"}
