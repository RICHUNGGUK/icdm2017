To that end, the field is roughly divided into three large areas related to Sound, Music, and Interaction, respectively, and within each of these, major research trends are briefly described. In addition, for each sub-field a small number of open research (or research strategy) issues are identified that should be addressed in order to further advance the SMC field.", "paper_title": "Sound and Music Computing: Research trends and some key issues", "paper_id": "WOS:000254577900004"}
