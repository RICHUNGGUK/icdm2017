We are able to establish the radial symmetry and monotonicity theorem for those positive solutions by means of the new moving-plane method proposed by Chen-Li-Ou [W. Chen, C. Li, B. Ou, Classification of solutions for an integral equation, Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 59 (3) (2006) 330-343] coupled with a Sobolev imbedding theorem involving Bessel potentials. We also obtain the uniqueness theorem for some radial symmetric solutions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
