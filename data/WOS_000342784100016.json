Towards this core principle, plenty of efforts have been put into collaborative contribution and editing. The trajectories of how such collaboration appears by revisions are valuable for group dynamics and social media research, which suggest that we should extract the underlying derivation relationships among revisions from chronologically-sorted revision history in a precise way. In this paper, we propose a revision graph extraction method based on supergram decomposition in the document collection of near-duplicates. The plain text of revisions would be measured by its frequency distribution of supergram, which is the variable-length token sequence that keeps the same through revisions. We show that this method can effectively perform the task than existing methods.", "paper_title": "Revision Graph Extraction in Wikipedia Based on Supergram Decomposition and Sliding Update", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784100016"}
