From this field comes a large demand for cheaper and more flexible ways of 3D reconstruction. This paper describes a web-based 3D reconstruction service, developed to relieve those needs of the cultural heritage field. This service consists of a pipeline that starts with the user uploading images of an object or scene(s) he wants to reconstruct in 3D. The automatic reconstruction process, running on a server connected to a cluster of computers, computes the camera calibration, as well as dense depth (or range-) maps for the images. This result can be downloaded from an ftp server and visualized with a specific tool running on the user's PC.", "paper_title": "Web-based 3D reconstruction service", "paper_id": "WOS:000241687000006"}
