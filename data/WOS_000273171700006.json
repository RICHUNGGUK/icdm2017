We define several criteria to measure the quality of responses in WSN applications. Guided by an extensive experimental study, we discuss in detail the performance impacts of different deployment factors on algorithms that implement both centralized and in-network computing. Finally, performance guidelines are given to algorithm designers for WSN applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
