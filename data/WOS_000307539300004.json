A small neighborhood window of proper size is first chosen and they slide over the entire inspection image in a pixel-by-pixel basis. The regularity measure for each image patch enclosed in the window is then derived from the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix formed by the variance-covariance of the x- and y-coordinates with the pixel gray levels as the weights for all pixel points in the window. The two eigenvalues of the weighted covariance matrix will be approximately the same when the image patch contains only a homogeneous region, whereas the two eigenvalues will be relatively different if the image patch in the window contains a defect. The smaller eigenvalue of the covariance matrix is then used as the regularity measure. The integral image technique is introduced to the computation of the regularity measure so that it is invariant to the neighborhood window size. The proposed method uses only one single discrimination feature for defect detection. It avoids the use of complicated classifiers in a high-dimensional feature space, and requires no learning process from a set of defective and defect-free training samples. Experimental results on a variety of material surfaces found in industry, including textured images of plastic surfaces and leather and non-textured images of backside solar wafers and LCD backlight panels, have shown the effectiveness of the proposed regularity measure for surface defect detection. It is computationally very fast, and takes only 0.032 s for a 400 x 400 image on a Pentium 3.00 GHz personal computer. In a test set of 73 backside solar wafer images involving 53 defect-free and 20 defective samples, the proposed regularity measure can correctly identify all the test images.", "paper_title": "A fast regularity measure for surface defect detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000307539300004"}
