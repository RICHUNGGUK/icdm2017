In particular, first we generalize the unsupervised method to more general metrics instead of the Euclidean, as it was used in the original algorithm. Thereafter, we extend the model to a supervised learning method resulting in a fuzzy classification algorithm. Thereby, we allow fuzzy labels for both, data and prototypes. Finally, we transfer the idea of relevance learning for metric adaptation known from learning vector quantization to the new approach. We show the abilities and the power of the method for exemplary and real-world medical applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
