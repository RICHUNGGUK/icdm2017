The proposed method allows the degrees of satisfiability and non-satisfiability of each alternative with respect to a set of criteria to be represented by intuitionistic fuzzy sets, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method allows the decision-maker to assign the degrees of membership and non-membership of the criteria to the fuzzy concept \"importance.\" The method proposed here can provide a useful way to efficiently help the decision-maker to make his decision.
