These models require the specification of an important smoothing parameter, which is usually chosen by crossvalidation or clustering. In this letter, we demonstrate the problems with the cross-validation and clustering approaches to specify the smoothing parameter, discuss the relationship between this parameter and some of the data statistics, and attempt to develop a fast approach to determine the optimal value of this parameter. Finally, through experimentation, we show that our approach, referred to as a gap-based estimation approach, is superior in speed to the compared approaches, including support vector machine, and yields good and stable accuracy.", "paper_title": "Gap-based estimation: Choosing the smoothing parameters for Probabilistic and general regression neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243800012"}
