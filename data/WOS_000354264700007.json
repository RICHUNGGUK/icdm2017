While human-like emotionality has been vastly explored in the last 20years, little research addresses explicit, psychologically believable social situation modeling. Recently, some important elements have been underlined: hybrid connectionist models outside formal ontologies; complex subjective representations linking culture, personality and norms, and so on, but proposed solutions do not provide a formalized structure of a social experience, expressive and well-grounded in psychology. In this paper, we develop a new approach to social situation modeling based on the dramaturgical and dissonance theories. A new component (Dramaturgical Module) is described with implementation used to generate example behavior depicting new social modeling capabilities and a believable representation of the relevant psychological theories. We present a case scenario with a dramaturgical interpretation of dynamic social situations and related cognitive dissonances resulting in a simple and flexible classification. Easily usable in reasoning, planning or affect generation, dramaturgical interpretation is additionally presented here as basis of social affect generation.
