The nonlinear plant is represented by Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy-affine dynamic models with norm-bounded uncertainties, and stochastic variables with general probability distributions are adopted to characterize the data missing phenomenon in output channels. The objective is to design an admissible state estimator guaranteeing the stochastic stability of the resulting estimation-error system with a prescribed H(infinity) disturbance attenuation level. It is assumed that the plant premise variables, which are often the state variables or their functions, are not measurable so that the estimator implementation with state-space partition may not be synchronized with the state trajectories of the plant. Based on a piecewise-quadratic Lyapunov function combined with S-procedure and some matrix-inequality-convexifying techniques, two different approaches are developed to robust filtering design for the underlying T-S fuzzy-affine systems with unreliable communication links. All the solutions to the problem are formulated in the form of linear-matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Nonsynchronized-State Estimation of Multichannel Networked Nonlinear Systems With Multiple Packet Dropouts Via T-S Fuzzy-Affine Dynamic Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000286932000007"}
