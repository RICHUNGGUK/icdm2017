This problem goes back to the 50s and was first related to the identifiability problem for Hidden Markov Models, then to the determination of internal structures for compartmental systems and later embedded in the more general framework of positive systems theory. Within this framework, the positive realization problem was reformulated in terms of a geometric condition which was recently exploited as a tool for finding the solution to the existence problem and providing partial answers to the minimality problem. The lecture intends to present, by means of several examples, the key ideas which have proved to be useful in order to tackle this problem and illustrate main results, contributions and open problems.", "paper_title": "The positive realization problem: Past and future challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400002"}
