To achieve this goal, we develop a software testbed that simulates different fault injection strategies, and we perform a thorough experimental study using a combination of several fault parameters. Our experiments give evidence that simple-minded approaches to this problem are largely impractical, while the design of more sophisticated resilient algorithms seems really worth the effort. Another contribution of our computational study is a carefully engineered implementation of a resilient sorting algorithm, which appears robust to different memory fault patterns.", "paper_title": "The price of resiliency: A case study on sorting with memory faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200066"}
