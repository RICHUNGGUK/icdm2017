The resultant structure, whether truss or rigid frame, is subjected to stress and displacement constraints under multiple load cases. The members' sections are selected from an available set of profiles. A table that contains sectional properties for all the available profiles is used directly in structural optimization. Each profile in the table is assigned by a unique profile number, which is used as the integer design variable for each of the structural members. It is proposed that we use a revised DLM search algorithm with static weighting to design trusses and rigid frames for minimum weight. Five examples are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. It is shown that, for monotonic as well as nonmonotonic constraint functions, the DLM is effective and robust for the discrete sizing design of skeletal structures.", "paper_title": "A revised discrete Lagrangian-based search algorithm for the optimal design of skeletal structures using available sections", "paper_id": "WOS:000235447600004"}
