And we compare our proposed dissimilarity measure with some existing distances through some numerical examples which show that our proposed dissimilarity measure is more robust and efficient. Finally, we apply our proposed dissimilarity measure in multiple attribute decision making(MADM) and the conclusion shows our proposed dissimilarity measure is available.", "paper_title": "A new dissimilarity measure between intuitionistic fuzzy sets and its application in multiple attribute decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000364407900006"}
