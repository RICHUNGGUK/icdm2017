Recent technology developments have resulted in displays that enable 3D viewing without glasses. In this paper, we present results from our proposed approach to automatic rectification of two images of the same scene captured by cameras at general positions, so that the results can be viewed on a 3D display. Both simulated and real data experiments are presented.", "paper_title": "Image rectification for stereoscopic visualization without 3D glasses", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500052"}
