Compared with other techniques for indoor coverage, femtocells achieve better user experience with less capital expenditure and maintenance cost. However, co-channel deployments of closed subscriber group femtocells cause coverage holes in macrocells due to co-channel interference. To address this problem, cognitive radio technology has been integrated with femtocells. CR-enabled femtocells can actively sense their environment and exploit the network side information obtained from sensing to adaptively mitigate interference. We investigate three CR-enabled interference mitigation techniques, including opportunistic interference avoidance, interference cancellation, and interference alignment. Macrocell activities can be obtained without significant overhead in femtocells. In this article, we present a joint opportunistic interference avoidance scheme with Gale-Shapley spectrum sharing (GSOIA) based on the interweave paradigm to mitigate both tier interferences in macro/femto heterogeneous networks. In this scheme, cognitive femtocells opportunistically communicate over available spectrum with minimal interference to macrocells; different femtocells are assigned orthogonal spectrum resources with a one-to-one matching policy to avoid intratier interference. Our simulations show considerable performance improvement of the GSOIA scheme and validate the potential benefits of CR-enabled femtocells for in-home coverage.", "paper_title": "COGNITIVE FEMTOCELL NETWORKS: AN OPPORTUNISTIC SPECTRUM ACCESS FOR FUTURE INDOOR WIRELESS COVERAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000318518300008"}
