Our aim is to provide an algorithmic characterization that (i) answers the decision problem: to determine whether a given function over is polynomially representable or not, and (ii) finds the polynomial if it is polynomially representable. The previous characterizations given by Kempner (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 22(2):240-266, 1921) and Carlitz (Acta Arith. 9(1), 67-78, 1964) are existential in nature and only lead to an exhaustive search method, i.e. algorithm with complexity exponential in size of the input. Our characterization leads to an algorithm whose running time is linear in size of input. We also extend our result to the multivariate case.", "paper_title": "An Algorithmic Characterization of Polynomial Functions over Z(pn)", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206400012"}
