However, security and privacy become major concerns when data owners outsource their private data onto public cloud servers that are not within their trusted management domains. To avoid information leakage, sensitive data have to be encrypted before uploading onto the cloud servers, which makes it a big challenge to support efficient keyword-based queries and rank the matching results on the encrypted data. Most current works only consider single keyword queries without appropriate ranking schemes. In the current multi-keyword ranked search approach, the keyword dictionary is static and cannot be extended easily when the number of keywords increases. Furthermore, it does not take the user behavior and keyword access frequency into account. For the query matching result which contains a large number of documents, the out-of-order ranking problem may occur. This makes it hard for the data consumer to find the subset that is most likely satisfying its requirements. In this paper, we propose a flexible multi-keyword query scheme, called MKQE to address the aforementioned drawbacks. MKQE greatly reduces the maintenance overhead during the keyword dictionary expansion. It takes keyword weights and user access history into consideration when generating the query result. Therefore, the documents that have higher access frequencies and that match closer to the users' access history get higher rankings in the matching result set. Our experiments show that MKQE presents superior performance over the current solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
