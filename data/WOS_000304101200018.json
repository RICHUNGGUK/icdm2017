Some improvements are introduced so as to get a higher performance. The proposed analog multiplier can work precisely in four quadrants with a very small THD. An added OTA keeps the linearity error of the circuit smaller than 1%. The presented multiplier is designed on the 0.6 mu m BCD process and the simulation results by HSPICE shows a perfect performance. It can be used in any system that requires a high performance analog multiplier.", "paper_title": "A four-quadrant analog multiplier under a single power supply voltage", "paper_id": "WOS:000304101200018"}
