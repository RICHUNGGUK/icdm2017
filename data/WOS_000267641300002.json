A human-human interactive modeling is achieved by immediate local execution of modeling operations and exchange of modeling operations across all collaborative sites real-time. In particular, an approach to achieve topological entity correspondence across collaborative sites during modeling procedure, which is critical to guarantee the correctness and consistency of collaborative modeling result, is proposed. A prototype system based on the ACIS geometric modeling kernel is implemented to verify availability of the proposed solution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
