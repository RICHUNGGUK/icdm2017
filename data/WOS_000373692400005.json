Malicious activities over secured and unsecured channels have posed a lot of challenges to privacy and security of users in today's cyber. In avoiding video tapping and eaves dropping on communication systems, cryptographic security approaches are highly needed to ensure data confidentiality, integrity and authentication. I contributing to the promotion and adoption of cryptographic approaches to video communications systems with today's cyber space, we proposed a symmetric key cryptographic encryption technique of MPEG digital video images based on RGB pixel transposition and shuffling. The cryptographic encryption technique made use of the Red, Green and Blue channels in the encryption and securing of the digital images with the engagement of a generated symmetric key for the ciphering process. The results obtained from the process were very effective and our approach proved to be very effective against brute force attack. The programming and implementation was done using MATLAB.", "paper_title": "A Symmetric Key Cryptographic Encryption Technique of MPEG Digital Video Images Based on RGB Pixel Transposition and Shuffling", "paper_id": "WOS:000373692400005"}
