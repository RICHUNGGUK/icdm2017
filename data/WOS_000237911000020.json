In this representation, the initial value problem is solved by applying the fundamental solution exp(-itH) to the initial field configuration. The Faber polynomial approximation of the fundamental solution is used to develop a numerical algorithm for propagation of broad band wave packets in passive media. The action of the Hamiltonian on the wave function psi is approximated by the Fourier grid pseudospectral method. The algorithm is global in time, meaning that the entire propagation can be carried out in just a few time steps. A typical time step Delta t(F) is much larger than that in finite differencing schemes, Delta t(F) >> parallel to H parallel to(-1). The accuracy and stability of the algorithm is analyzed. The Faber propagation method is compared with the Lanczos-Arnoldi propagation method with an example of scattering of broad band laser pulses on a periodic grating made of a dielectric whose dispersive properties are described by the Rocard-Powels-Debye model. The Faber algorithm is shown to be more efficient. The Courant limit for time stepping, Delta t(C) similar to parallel to H parallel to(-1), is exceeded at least in 3000 times in the Faber propagation scheme. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
