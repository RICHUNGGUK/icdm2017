This ensures the anonymity of the users in the logs, a problem that has been already found in released logs from well known companies. This paper presents the anonymization of query logs using microaggregation. Our proposal ensures the k-anonymity of the users in the query log, while preserving its utility. We provide the evaluation of our proposal in real query logs, showing the privacy and utility achieved, as well as providing estimations for the use of such data in data mining processes based on clustering.
