Instead of relying on relative poor representation of facial features in a. at vector form, the approach utilizes a format of tree structures with Gabor feature representations to present a facial emotional state. The novel local experts organization (LEO) model is proposed for the processing of this tree structure representation. The motivation for the LEO model is to deal with the inconsistent length of features in case there are some features failed to be detected. The proposed LEO model is inspired by the natural hierarchical model presented in natural organization, where workers (local experts) reports to their supervisor (fusion classifier), whom in turn reports to upper management (global fusion classifier). Moreover, an Asian emotion database is created. The database contains high-resolution images of 153 Asian subjects in six basic pseudo-emotions (excluding neutral expression) in three different poses for evaluating our proposed system. Empirical studies were conducted to benchmark our approach with other well-known classifiers applying to the system, and the results showed that our approach is the most robust, and less affected by noise from feature locators for the face emotion recognition system.
