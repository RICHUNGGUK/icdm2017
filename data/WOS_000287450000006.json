Most previous methods focus separately on binary immiscible mixing fluids or binary miscible mixing fluids. Until now, little attention has been paid to realistic simulation of multiple mixing fluids. In this paper, based on the solution principles in physics, we present a unified framework for realistic simulation of liquid-liquid mixing with different solubility, which is called LLSPH. In our method, the mixing process of miscible fluids is modeled by a heat-conduction-based Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics method. A special self-diffusion coefficient is designed to simulate the interactions between miscible fluids. For immiscible fluids, marching-cube-based method is adopted to trace the interfaces between different types of fluids efficiently. Then, an optimized spatial hashing method is adopted for simulation of boundary-free mixing fluids such as the marine oil spill. Finally, various realistic scenes of mixing fluids are rendered using our method.", "paper_title": "Realistic simulation of mixing fluids", "paper_id": "WOS:000287450000006"}
