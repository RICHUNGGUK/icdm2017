It is a 1D curve that captures topology of the 3D object. The proposed method extracts a curve skeleton from the vector field inside the 3D object. A vector at each voxel of the 3D object is calculated using a pseudonormal vector. By using such a calculation, the computation time is significantly reduced compared with using a typical potential field. A curve skeleton is then extracted from the pseudonormal vector field by using a skeleton-growing algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses high-curvature boundary voxels to search for a set of critical points and skeleton branches near high-curvature areas. The set of detected critical points is then used to grow a curve skeleton in the next step. All parameters of our algorithms are calculated from the 3D object itself, without user intervention. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in our experiments.", "paper_title": "Skeleton growing: an algorithm to extract a curve skeleton from a pseudonormal vector field", "paper_id": "WOS:000316783800004"}
