In this paper, we study strategic problems of WMNs such as selecting the gateway nodes along with several operational problems such as routing, power control, and transmission slot assignment. Under the assumptions of the physical interference model and the tree-based routing restriction for traffic flow, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is presented, in which the objective is to maximize the minimum service level provided at the nodes. A set of valid inequalities is derived and added to the model in an attempt to improve the solution quality. Since the MILP formulation becomes computationally infeasible for larger instances, we propose a heuristic method that is aimed at solving the problem in two stages. In the first stage, we devise a simple MILP problem that is concerned only with the selection of gateway nodes. In the second stage, the MILP problem in the original formulation is solved by fixing the gateway nodes from the first stage. Computational experiments are provided to evaluate the proposed models and the heuristic method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
