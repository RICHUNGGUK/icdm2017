The total domination number gamma (t) (G) is the minimum cardinality of a total dominating set of G. The total domination subdivision number sd(gamma t) (G) is the minimum number of edges that must be subdivided (each edge in G can be subdivided at most once) in order to increase the total domination number. In this paper we prove that sd(gamma t) (G) <= (gamma t)(G) + 1 for some classes of graphs.", "paper_title": "On the total domination subdivision number in some classes of graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000280232600005"}
