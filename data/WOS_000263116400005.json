This paper proposes and evaluates two methodologies for making appropriate (re)use of natural language photographic annotations for extracting references to people, location and objects and propagating any location references encountered to previously unannotated images. The evaluation identifies the strengths of each approach and shows extraction and propagation results with promising accuracy.", "paper_title": "Attributing semantics to personal photographs", "paper_id": "WOS:000263116400005"}
