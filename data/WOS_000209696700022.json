Planar tessellations, such as square and hexagonal tessellations, have found a wide range of applications in the analysis of wireless networks. A geometric probabilistic model is considered for interference estimation in wireless ad-hoc networks, utilizing the distance distributions for hexagonal and square tessellations. The impact of employing square and hexagonal regions is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that both models are accurate.", "paper_title": "On Planar Tessellations and Interference Estimation in Wireless Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700022"}
