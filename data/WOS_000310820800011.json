The robustness of MI is closely restricted by the choice of MI window sizes. For unsupervised human monitoring applications, obtaining appropriate MI window sizes for computing MI in videos with multiple people in different sizes and different levels of occlusion is problematic. In this work, we apply local self-similarity (LSS) as a dense multimodal similarity metric and show its adequacy and strengths compared to MI for a human ROIs registration. We also propose an LSS-based registration of thermal-visible stereo videos that addresses the problem of multiple people and occlusions in the scene. Our method improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art disparity voting (DV) correspondence algorithm by proposing a motion segmentation step that approximates depth segments in an image and enables assigning disparity to each depth segment using larger matching window while keeping registration accuracy. We demonstrate that our registration method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MI-based stereo registration for several realistic close-range indoor thermal-visible stereo videos of multiple people.
