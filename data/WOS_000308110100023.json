However, most of the existing algorithms' clustering criteria are limited to the node location information and ignore the nature and characteristics of the nodes as well as the requirements of the applications. In this paper, an autonomic concurrent General Criteria-based Clustering (GCC) method is proposed for multi-node computing systems. The GCC method is based on the neuron oscillator pulse-coupling model and its clustering criteria can come from any node-related data or properties. The cluster member nodes share similar physical or logical properties and represent those relationships in the form of Logical Clusters (LCs). Due to the neuron dynamic system basis of the method, there is concurrency that exists both on the whole network and on each individual node. The simulation shows that the GCC method can generate diverse logical clusters and synchronization/desynchronization coexistence results with acceptable time and energy usage.", "paper_title": "General criteria-based clustering method for multi-node computing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110100023"}
