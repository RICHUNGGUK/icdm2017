The impulsive effects considered can be not only nonidentical in different dimensions of the system state but also various at distinct impulsive instants. Hence, the impulses here can encompass several typical impulses in NNs. The aim of this paper is to derive stability criteria such that stochastic NNs with local impulsive effects are exponentially stable in mean square. By means of the mathematical induction method, several easy-to-check conditions are obtained to ensure the mean square stability of NNs. Three examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed stability criterion.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Stability of Delayed Neural Networks With Local Impulsive Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000362358800010"}
