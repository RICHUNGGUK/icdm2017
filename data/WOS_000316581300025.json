Our methodology is based on genetic algorithms and mutual information. The aim is to provide a system for user identification rather than a classification. Additionally, a robust hand segmentation method to extract the hand silhouette and a set of geometric features in hard and complex environments is described. This paper focuses on studying how important and discriminating the hand geometric features are, and if they are suitable in developing a robust and reliable biometric identification. Several public databases have been used to test our method. As a result, the number of required features have been drastically reduced from datasets with more than 400 features. In fact, good classification rates with about 50 features on average are achieved, with a 100% accuracy using the GA-LDA strategy for the GPDS database and 97% for the CASIA and IITD databases, approximately. For these last contact-less databases, reasonable EER rates are also obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
