The relationships can be briefly described as: the IS method is an iterative version of Otsu's method; Otsu's method can be regarded as a special case of the MET method. The purpose of this correspondence is to provide a comprehensive clarification, some practical implications and further discussions of these relationships. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
