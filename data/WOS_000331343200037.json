As a result, macro user equipments, particularly those located near a cell edge, will suffer from serious link performance degradation. We propose a novel interference avoidance mechanism assisted by the SRN (Shared Relay Node) in this letter. The SRN not only performs data re-transmission as a typical type-II relay, but has several newly defined features to avoid interference between cellular network and D2D links. The superb performance by the proposed scheme is evaluated through extensive system level simulations.", "paper_title": "Interference Avoidance Based on Shared Relay Nodes for Device-to-Device Radio Underlying Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000331343200037"}
