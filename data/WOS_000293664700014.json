However, this also introduces huge computation time due to the exhaustive check for all modes. In this paper, a fast spatial DIRECT mode decision method for profiles supporting B frame encoding (main profile, high profile, etc.) in H.264/AVC is proposed. Statistical analysis on multiple video sequences is carried out, and the strong relationship of mode selection and rate-distortion (RD) cost between the current DIRECT macroblock (MB) and the co-located MBs is observed. With the check of mode condition, predicted RD cost threshold and dynamic parameter update model, the complex mode decision process can be terminated at an early stage even for small QP cases. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed method can achieve much better performance than the original exhaustive rate-distortion optimization (RDO) based mode decision algorithm by reducing up to 56.8% of encoding time for IBPBP picture group and up to 67.8% of encoding time for IBBPBBP picture group while incurring only negligible bit increment and quality degradation.", "paper_title": "Fast H.264/AVC DIRECT Mode Decision Based on Mode Selection and Predicted Rate-Distortion Cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664700014"}
