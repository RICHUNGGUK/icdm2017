A classic measure for the fault tolerance of a network in the case of vertex failures is its connectivity. Given a network based on a graph G and a positive integer h, the R(h)-connectivity of G is the minimum cardinality of a set of vertices in G, if any, whose deletion disconnects C. and every remaining component has minimum degree at least h. This paper investigates the R(h)-connectivity of the (n, k)-arrangement graph A(n,) (k) for h = 1 and h = 2, and determines that kappa(1) (A(n, k)) = (2k - 1)(n - k) - 1 and kappa(2)(A(n, k)) = (3k - 2)(n - k) - 2, respectively.
