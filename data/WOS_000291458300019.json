For the particular case of the industrial gas business, we are interested in predicting the cost to deliver bulk (liquefied) gas to new customers using a multifactor linear regression model. Developing a single model, i.e. analyzing the observations all at once, produces poor prediction results. Therefore prior to the regression analysis, a new supervised learning technique is used to group customers who are similar in some sense. Classes of customers are represented by hyper-boxes and a linear regression model is subsequently built within each class. The combination of data classification and regression is proven to increase the accuracy of the prediction. Two Mixed-Integer-Linear Programming (MILP) models are developed for data classification purposes. Although we are dealing with a supervised learning method, classes are not predefined in our case. Rather, we input a continuous \"classification\" attribute that is optimally discretized by the MILP's in order to minimize the number of misclassifications. Therefore our data classification model offers a broader range of applications. A number of illustrative examples are used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
