The Twin SVM formulation is in the spirit of proximal SVMs via generalized eigenvalues. On several benchmark data sets, Twin SVM is not only fast, but shows good generalization. Twin SVM is also useful for automatically discovering two-dimensional projections of the data.", "paper_title": "Twin support vector machines for pattern classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000244855700014"}
