We compare the results of such regression models to the standard approach which is to include only SNP5 that achieve genome-wide significance. Using mean square prediction error as the model metric, our simulation results suggest that by using the coefficient of determination (R(2)) value as a guideline to increase or reduce the number of SNP5 included in the regression model, we can achieve better prediction quality than the standard approach. However, important parameters such as trait heritability, the approximate number of QTL5, etc. have to be determined from previous studies or have to be estimated accurately.", "paper_title": "Quantitative trait prediction based on genetic marker-array data, a simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000288277300001"}
