This problem consists in making the appropriate worker-task assignment in a software project so the cost and duration of the project are minimized. We present the design of a Max-Min Ant System algorithm using the Hyper-Cube framework to solve it. This framework improves the performance of the algorithm. We illustrate experimental results and compare with other techniques demonstrating the feasibility and robustness of the approach, while reaching competitive solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
