Our method consists of two steps. First, a novel scale-free network clustering approach is applied to such a biomolecular network to obtain various subnetworks. Second, computational models are generated for the subnetworks and simulated to predict their behavior in the cellular context. We discuss and evaluate some of the advanced computational modeling approaches, in particular, state-space modeling, probabilistic Boolean network modeling, and fuzzy logic modeling. The modeling and simulation results represent hypotheses that are tested against high-throughput biological datasets (microarrays and/or genetic screens) under normal and perturbation conditions. Experimental results on time-series gene expression data for the human cell cycle indicate that our approach, is promising for subnetwork mining and simulation from large biomolecular networks.", "paper_title": "Mining, Modeling, and Evaluation of Subnetworks From Large Biomolecular Networks and Its Comparison Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000264059200006"}
