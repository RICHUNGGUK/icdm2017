Such models try to reproduce real environments and situations of interest within such environments. Most MABS platforms used today (e.g. MASON, Repast, NetLogo) see agents as very simple entities. However, there are situations in which a more intelligent kind of agent is needed. For example, when a society of persons with different roles and high-level behaviours must be modelled. In this paper, we address how to incorporate agents with cognitive skills into MABS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
