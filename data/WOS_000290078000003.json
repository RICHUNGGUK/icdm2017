We summarize the state-of-the-art for linear systems and then develop a novel algorithm for computing reachable states for nonlinear systems. We report experimental results obtained using a prototype implementation applied to several biological models. We believe these results constitute a promising contribution to the analysis of complex models of biological systems. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
