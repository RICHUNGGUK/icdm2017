Here we propose such a method, starting with a set of sloppily pasted image pieces with gaps between them. We first extract salient curves that approach the gaps from non-tangential directions, and use likely correspondences between pairs of such curves to guide a novel tele-registration method that simultaneously aligns all the pieces together. A structure-driven image completion technique is then proposed to fill the gaps, allowing the subsequent employment of standard in-painting tools to finish the job.", "paper_title": "Mind the Gap: Tele-Registration for Structure-Driven Image Completion", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200018"}
