A special feature of the genomic data is that genes participating in a common metabolic pathway or sharing a similar biological function tend to have high correlations. The collinearity naturally embedded in these data requires special handling, which cannot be provided by existing variable selection methods. In this paper, we propose a set of new methods to select variables in correlated data. The new methods follow the forward selection procedure of least angle regression (LARS) but conduct grouping and selecting at the same time. The methods specially work when no prior information on group structures of data is available. Simulations and real examples show that our proposed methods often outperform the existing variable selection methods, including LARS and elastic net, in terms of both reducing prediction error and preserving sparsity of representation.", "paper_title": "Group variable selection for data with dependent structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056500008"}
