The instruction set and its architecture are specially designed for OFDM systems, such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), scrambling/descrambling, puncturing, convolutional encoding, interleaving/deinterleaving, etc. SPOCS employs the optimized Data Processing Unit (DPU) to support the proposed instructions and the FFT Address Generation Unit (FAGU) to automatically calculate input/output data addresses. In addition, the proposed Bit Manipulation Unit (BMU) supports efficient bit manipulation operations. SPOCS has been synthesized using the SEC 0.18 mu m standard cell library and has a much smaller area than commercial DSP chips. SPOCS can reduce the number of clock cycles over 8%similar to 53% for FFT and about 48%similar to 84% for scrambling, convolutional encoding and interleaving compared with existing DSP chips. SPOCS can support various OFDM communication standards, such as Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), Digital Video Broadcasting-Terrestrial (DVB-T), etc.", "paper_title": "SPOCS: Application Specific Signal Processor for OFDM Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000259920500011"}
