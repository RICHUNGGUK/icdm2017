In \"standard\" constructions based on Feynman's Hamiltonian, such a gap decreases polynomially with the number of gates in the circuit, L. Because a larger gap implies a smaller cost, we study the limits of spectral gap amplification in this context. We show that, under some assumptions on the ground states and the cost of evolving with the Hamiltonians (which apply to the standard constructions), an upper bound on the gap of the order 1= L follows. In addition, if the Hamiltonians satisfy a frustration-free property, the upper bound is of the order 1= L-2. Our proofs use recent results on adiabatic state transformations, spectral gap amplification, and the simulation of continuoustime quantum query algorithms. They also consider a reduction from the unstructured search problem, whose lower bound in the oracle cost translates into the upper bounds in the gaps. The impact of our results is that improving the gap beyond that of standard constructions (i. e. 1= L-2), if possible, is challenging.", "paper_title": "ON THE GAP OF HAMILTONIANS FOR THE ADIABATIC SIMULATION OF QUANTUM CIRCUITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000331244200002"}
