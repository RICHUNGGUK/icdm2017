In this paper, we propose new feature weighting methods based on genetic algorithms. These methods use the cost function defined in LKM as a fitness function. We present new methods based on Darwinian, Lamarckian, and Baldwinian evolution. For each one of them, we describe evolutionary and coevolutionary versions. We compare classical hill-climbing optimization with these six genetic algorithms on different datasets. The results show that the proposed methods, except Darwinian methods, are always better than the LKM algorithm.", "paper_title": "Darwinian, Lamarckian, and Baldwinian (Co)Evolutionary Approaches for Feature Weighting in K-MEANS-Based Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000260046900007"}
