In this paper, we propose a general post-filtering framework to enhance robustness and accuracy of semantic concept detection using association and temporal analysis for concept knowledge discovery. Co-occurrence of several semantic concepts could imply the presence of other concepts. We use association mining techniques to discover such inter-concept association relationships from annotations. With discovered concept association rules, we propose a strategy to combine associated concept classifiers to improve detection accuracy. In addition, because video is often visually smooth and semantically coherent, detection results from temporally adjacent shots could be used for the detection of the current shot. We propose temporal filter designs for inter-shot temporal dependency mining to further improve detection accuracy. Experiments on the TRECVID 2005 dataset show our post-filtering framework is both efficient and effective in improving the accuracy of semantic concept detection in video. Furthermore, it is easy to integrate our framework with existing classifiers to boost their performance.", "paper_title": "Association and temporal rule mining for post-filtering of semantic concept detection in video", "paper_id": "WOS:000252576700008"}
