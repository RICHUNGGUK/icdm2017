This was achieved by carrying out a simulation study: an artificial mechanism and a group of managers were observed while performing the same tasks. The analysis of this simulation led to interesting insights. First, the study highlights the distinctive nature of group cognitive activities. Second, a notion of bounded rationality can be applied to groups as well as the use of heuristics. Third, this article explores the structure of the representation of knowledge and problem-solving and shows how decisions in complex information environments can be represented by a combination of simple rules. Finally, this study establishes a link between estimation and learning processes.", "paper_title": "Group level learning and decision making: a simulation of a group of managers", "paper_id": "WOS:000291014500001"}
