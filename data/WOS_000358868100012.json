Under mild conditions, we establish sublinear convergence of the considered method for general convex functions. Moreover, we show that the rate of convergence is R-linear for strongly convex functions. We extend the convergence results to different versions of the method based on a general GLL non-monotone line search, an adaptive non-monotone line search, and a non-monotone line search that requires an average of the successive function values decreases.", "paper_title": "On the rate of convergence of projected Barzilai-Borwein methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000358868100012"}
