A comparison between calculated C1s core-level binding energies and electron spectroscopy measurements showed that graphene nucleates from isolated carbon atoms adsorbed on surface defects or sub-superficial layers upon hydrocarbon fragmentation. In this respect, ab initio nudged elastic band simulations yield the energetic barriers characterizing the diffusion of elemental carbon on the Cu(111) surface and atomic carbon uptake by the growing graphene film. Our calculations highlight a strong interaction between the growing film edges and the copper substrate, indicative of the importance of the grain boundaries in the epitaxy process. Furthermore, we used activation energies to compute the reaction rates for the different mechanisms occurring at the carbon-copper interface via harmonic transition state theory. Finally, we simulated the long-time system growth evolution through a kinetic Monte Carlo approach for different temperatures and coverage. Our ab initio and Monte Carlo simulations of the out-of-equilibrium system point towards a growth model strikingly different from that of standard film growth. Graphene growth on copper turns out to be a catalytic, thermally-activated process that nucleates from carbon monomers, proceeds by adsorption of carbon atoms, and is not self-limiting. Furthermore, graphene growth seems to be more effective at carbon supersaturation of the surface-a clear fingerprint of a large activation barrier for C attachment. Our growth model and computational results are in good agreement with recent X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy experimental measurements.", "paper_title": "Computational study of graphene growth on copper by first-principles and kinetic Monte Carlo calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884800048"}
