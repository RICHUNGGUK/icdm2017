For the process parameters having strong nonlinear relationships with the logarithm of leakage current, the proposed model uses the LUT approach for the sake of modeling accuracy. For the other process parameters, it uses the first-order model for increased efficiency. During the library characterization for each type of logic gates, the proposed approach determines the process parameters for which it will use the LUT model. And, it determines the number of LUT data points, which can maximize analysis efficiency with acceptable accuracy, based on the user-defined threshold. The proposed model was implemented for gate-level MC leakage analysis using three graphic processing units. In experiments, the proposed approach exhibited the average errors of <5% in both mean and standard deviation with reference to SPICE-level MC leakage analysis. In comparison, MC analysis with the first-order model exhibited more than 90% errors. In CPU times, the proposed hybrid approach took only two to five times longer runtimes. In comparison with the full LUT model, the proposed hybrid model was up to one hundred times faster while increasing the average errors by only 3%. Finally, the proposed approach completed a leakage analysis of an OpenSparc T2 core of 4.5 million gates with a runtime of <5 min.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Gate-Level Leakage Model for Monte Carlo Analysis on Multiple GPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800014"}
