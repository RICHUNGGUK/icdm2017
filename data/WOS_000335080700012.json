Next we state the well-known FCM algorithm which lets one to extract Type 1 membership values from a given data set for the development of Type 1 fuzzy system models as a foundation for the development of Full Type 2 fuzzy system models. For this purpose, we describe how one can generate Full Type 2 membership value distributions for a development of second order fuzzy system models with our proposed second order data analysis. We also suggest that a recursive restatement of FCM algorithm can allow the generation of Full Type 3 and ... Type n fuzzy system models if one were to investigate such system models in the future.
