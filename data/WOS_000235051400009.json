The methods are based on Luenberger's algebraic methods to design both full-order and reduced-order observers. The procedure for reduced-order observers uses the bicausality concept to simplify some classical matrix calculations ( the calculation of matrix inverses is not needed), which is an important improvement mainly for large-scale systems. The calculation of the observer gains is based on the pole-placement techniques for linear systems modelled by bond graphs. As an application, both observers are designed for a vehicle suspension modelled by bond graphs.", "paper_title": "Luenberger observers for linear time-invariant systems modelled by bond graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235051400009"}
