This model addresses physical degradation, such as aging and ink seepage. Based on the diffusive nature of the physical defects, the model is designed using virtual diffusion processes. Then, based on this degradation model, a restoration method is proposed and used to fix the bleed-through effect in double-sided document images using the reverse diffusion process. Subjective and objective evaluations are performed on both the degradation model and the restoration method. The experiments show promising results on both real and generated data.", "paper_title": "Low quality document image modeling and enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000265918100002"}
