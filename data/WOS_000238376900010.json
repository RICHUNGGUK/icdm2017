The analysis takes into account major aspects commonly found in the forward data channel and applies the generalized Shannon capacity formula for multi-element antenna (MEA) systems. The study focuses on the physical layer and is flexible for various propagation environments, antenna configurations, multicode allocations, user distributions, and cell site configurations. Numerical results for various multicode allocations are presented for a system model with two-tier interfering cells operating under a frequency selective slow fading channel with propagation environments specified in the Recommendation ITU-R M. 1225.
