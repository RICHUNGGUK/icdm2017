When users type general or ambiguous textual queries, our system MQSS provides keyword suggestions and representative image examples in an easy-to-use dropdown manner which can help users specify their search intent more precisely and effortlessly. It is a powerful complement to initial queries. After the queries are formulated as multimodal query (i.e., text, image), the new queries are input to individual search models, such as text-based, concept-based and visual example-based search model. Then we apply multimodal fusion method to aggregate the above-mentioned several search results. The effectiveness of MQSS is demonstrated by evaluations over a web video data set.", "paper_title": "MQSS: multimodal query suggestion and searching for video search", "paper_id": "WOS:000291061100004"}
