Recently, academics and industry researchers have been paying increasing attention to the video streaming services over high-speed rail environments. For providing the quality of service of video streaming, we present a novel mobile proxy architecture for improving the system performance over high-speed trains in Long Term Evolution-Advanced networks. The mobile proxy not only saves the wireless bandwidth consumption between the base station and the high-speed train but also reduces the starting delay time of the video. Moreover, we propose a score-based replacement scheme in the memory management of the proxy server based on the feature of the video. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides a better performance than other existing cache management schemes.", "paper_title": "A Mobile Proxy Architecture for Video Services Over High-Speed Rail Environments in LTE-A Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365406200016"}
