Grid computing, as a recent development in the landscape of distributed computing, is deemed as a good solution for distributed geospatial data management and manipulation. Thus, the Grid computing technology can be applied to integrate various distributed resources into a 'super-computer' that enables efficient distributed geospatial query processing. In order to realize this vision, an effective mechanism for building the distributed geospatial query workflow in the Grid environment needs to be elaborately designed. The workflow-building technology aims to automatically transform the global geospatial query into an equivalent distributed query process in the Grid. In response to this goal, detailed steps and algorithms for building the distributed geospatial query workflow in the Grid environment are discussed in this article. Moreover, we develop corresponding software tools that enable Grid-based geospatial queries to be run against multiple data resources. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is feasible and correct.", "paper_title": "Building the distributed geographic SQL workflow in the Grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000295467600005"}
