Design/methodology/approach - The authors derive a model containing the relationships between PSQ and IMP and between PSQ and some antecedents of organizational adoption. The relationships were analysed with data from a survey of 217 Australian companies, using structural equation modelling. Findings - PSQ is an important antecedent to implementation success of ERP projects. It also has a positive influence on other antecedents of organizational adoption, namely: perceived information quality, organizational readiness and perceived strategic value of adoption. Research limitations/implications - Prior findings have shown that PSQ is a significant antecedent to the adoption of ERP by individuals and organizations and the paper extends this by providing evidence that PSQ is also a significant antecedent to implementation success. The authors have empirically established the role of interrelationships among antecedent factors at the adoption stage of ERP systems. Practical implications - Establishing a proposed ERP system's system quality, when considering whether to adopt a particular system is important, as it influences the other important antecedents and beliefs on the potential benefits from an ERP project. Understanding of system quality attributes can help managers put in place strategies to avoid potential pitfalls at the project implementation stage. Originality/value - Empirical evidence of the importance of PSQ for success in ERP adoption, implementation and explanation of how and why this has positive effects on other antecedents.", "paper_title": "Examining the role of system quality in ERP projects", "paper_id": "WOS:000317440200002"}
