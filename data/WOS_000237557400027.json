In many sports views, the camera covers a large part of the sports arena, so that the resolution of player's region is low. This makes the determination of the player's gestures and actions a challenging task, especially if there is large camera motion. To overcome these problems, we propose a method based on curvature scale space templates of the player's silhouette. The use of curvature scale space makes the method robust to noise and our method is robust to significant shape corruption of a part of player's silhouette. We also propose a new recognition method which is robust to noisy sequences of data and needs only a small amount of training data.", "paper_title": "Robust player gesture spotting and recognition in low-resolution sports video", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557400027"}
