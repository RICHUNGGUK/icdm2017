Adaptive interval type-2 FNN control scheme and H-infinity tracking approach are incorporated to synchronize two different chaotic systems and the effect of the synchronization error via adaptive fuzzy system relies only on the solution of an algebraic Riccati-like matrix equation. The Laypunov stability theorem has been used to testify the asymptotic stability of the chaotic systems. Moreover, the stability analysis of the proposed control scheme will be guaranteed in the sense that all signals involved are uniformly bounded and arbitrary small attenuation. level of the external disturbance on the synchronization error can be achieved. The simulation example is included to confirm validity and performance of the advocated design methodology.", "paper_title": "A NEW ADAPTIVE H-infinity CONTROL FOR CHAOS SYNCHRONIZATION BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT CHAOTIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400014"}
