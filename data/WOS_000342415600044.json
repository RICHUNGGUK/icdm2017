The constructions give new Boolean bent, generalized Boolean bent and p-ary bent functions. Based on Z(4)-valued quadratic forms, a simple method provides several new constructions of generalized Boolean bent functions. From these generalized Boolean bent functions a method is presented to transform them into Boolean bent and semi-bent functions. Moreover, many new p-ary bent functions can also be obtained by applying similar methods.", "paper_title": "New Constructions of Quadratic Bent Functions in Polynomial Form", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600044"}
