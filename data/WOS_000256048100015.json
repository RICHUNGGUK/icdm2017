And, under what interpretations can modem mathematics and the theory of computer science be kept as completely as possible? Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a conceptual discussion of the metatheory. Findings - The paper establishes the metatheory of the logical foundation for the mathematical system of potential infinities. Originality/value - The authors prove the relevant results on the reliability and the completeness of the logical system.", "paper_title": "Mathematical system of potential infinities (III) - meta theory of logical basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100015"}
