It uses a stochastic birth and death process to model the evolution of gene family sizes over a phylogeny. For a specified phylogenetic tree, and given the gene family sizes in the extant species, CAFE can estimate the global birth and death rate of gene families, infer the most likely gene family size at all internal nodes, identify gene families that have accelerated rates of gain and loss (quantified by a p-value) and identify which branches cause the p-value to be small for significant families.", "paper_title": "CAFE: a computational tool for the study of gene family evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000237319300018"}
