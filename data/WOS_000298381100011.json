Also, a repeated game model is designed to analyze how much the peers should contribute in each round under this incentive. Simulations show that satisfying streaming quality is achieved in the Nash Equilibrium state.", "paper_title": "How Much to Share: A Repeated Game Model for Peer-to-Peer Streaming under Service Differentiation Incentives", "paper_id": "WOS:000298381100011"}
