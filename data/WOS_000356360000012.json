They were also used in the constructions of DES-like iterated ciphers, error-correcting codes, and signal sets. Recently, a new notion of pseudo-planar functions in even characteristic was proposed by Zhou. These new pseudo-planar functions, as an analogue of planar functions in odd characteristic, also bring about finite projective planes. There are three known infinite families of pseudo-planar monomial functions constructed by Schmidt and Zhou, and Scherr and Zieve. In this paper, three new classes of pseudo-planar binomials are provided. Moreover, we find that each pseudo-planar function gives an association scheme which is defined on a Galois ring.", "paper_title": "New pseudo-planar binomials in characteristic two and related schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000356360000012"}
