The proposed methodology is based on a novel coarse-grained reconfigurable/flexible architectural template, which enables the combined exploitation of the horizontal and vertical parallelism along with the operation chaining opportunities found in the application's behavioral description. Efficient synthesis techniques exploiting these architectural optimization concepts from a higher level of abstraction are presented and analyzed. Extensive experimentation showed average latency and area reductions up to 33.9% and 53.9%, respectively, and higher hardware area utilization, compared to previously published high performance coarse-grained reconfigurable datapaths.", "paper_title": "High Performance and Area Efficient Flexible DSP Datapath Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000287671200007"}
