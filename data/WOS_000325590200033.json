Text extraction from natural scene images algorithms is generally composed of the following three stages: (i) detection and localization, (ii) text enhancement and segmentation and (iii) optical character recognition (OCR). The problem is challenging in nature due to variations in the font size and color, text alignment, illumination change and reflections. This paper aims to classify and assess the latest algorithms. More specifically, we draw attention to studies on the first two steps in the extraction process, since OCR is a well-studied area where powerful algorithms already exist. This paper offers to the researchers a link to public image database for the algorithm assessment of text extraction from natural scene images. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
