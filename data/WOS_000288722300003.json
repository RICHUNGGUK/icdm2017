As in traditional relational data models, existing RDF data views are defined by filtering out some of these triples. However, a finer-grained view definition could allow subject-or object-level filtering, which would be useful for many applications including view-based access controls. We have devised a sophisticated view definition method and a supporting system for RDF data. Since the subject and object of an RDF triple are usually resources, the finest unit of an RDF view definition is a resource rather than a triple. The resource is not disposed as is, but is formed in a more abstract form by hiding information details, if necessary. The final view is built up structurally, based on abstract resources. We implemented a view-based access control system RDF data on the proposed view definition system.", "paper_title": "A structural view definition for RDF data", "paper_id": "WOS:000288722300003"}
