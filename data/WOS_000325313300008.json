Firstly, we study some properties of M-fuzzifying rank functions. Then we introduce the concepts of M-fuzzy families of dependent sets and M-fuzzifying closure operators by which we can characterize M-fuzzifying matroids. Finally we give applications of fuzzifying matroids in combinatorial optimization.", "paper_title": "Characterizations and applications of M-fuzzifying matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000325313300008"}
