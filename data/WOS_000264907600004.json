Recently, Chen and Liu [Chen, J., Liu, M.Q., 2008a. Optimal mixed-level k-circulant supersaturated designs. J. Statist. Plann. Inference 138, 4151-4157] explored the construction of E(f(NOD))-optimal mixed-level SSDs using k-cyclic generators. As an extension, this paper further studies how to construct optimal mixed-level k-circulant SSDs under the chi(2)(D) criterion. A sufficient condition under which the generator vector produces a chi(2)(D)-optimal SSD is obtained, and some other properties of the resulting SSDs are investigated. Note that, the construction of optimal mixed-level k-circulant SSDs under the chi(2) (D) criterion is much more complicated than that under E(f(NOD)). Hence, an algorithm for finding generators of (nearly) chi(2)(D)-optimal designs is provided, and many (nearly) chi(2)(D)-optimal mixed-level SSDs are then constructed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
