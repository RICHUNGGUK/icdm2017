However, modern FPGA devices have both a high operating frequency and sufficient logic resources to be successfully used in these tasks. In this article, an advanced system that is able to generate and maintain a complex background model for a scene as well as segment the foreground for an HD colour video stream (1,920 x 1,080 @ 60 fps) in real-time is presented. The possible application ranges from video surveillance to machine vision systems. That is, in all cases, when information is needed about which objects are new or moving in the scene. Excellent results are obtained by using the CIE Lab colour space, advanced background representation as well as integrating information about lightness, colour and texture in the segmentation step. Finally, the complete system is implemented in a single high-end FPGA device.", "paper_title": "Real-time background generation and foreground object segmentation for high-definition colour video stream in FPGA device", "paper_id": "WOS:000331639800006"}
