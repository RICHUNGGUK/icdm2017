In this paper, we analyze the temporal delay degradation of logic circuits due to NBTI. We show that knowing the threshold-voltage degradation of a single transistor due to NBTI, one can predict the performance degradation of a circuit with a reasonable degree of accuracy. We also propose a sizing algorithm, taking the NBTI-affected performance degradation into account to ensure the reliability of nanoscale circuits for a given period of time. Experimental results on several benchmark circuits show that with an average of 8.7% increase in area, one can ensure a reliable performance of circuits for ten years.", "paper_title": "Negative bias temperature instability: Estimation and design for improved reliability of nanoscale circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000245190500013"}
