The proposed architecture aims to address the lack of flexibility that most agent-based collaborations are affected by. The resulting agents, equipped with advanced cognitive profiling, have an increased cognitive awareness of themselves and are more capable of interacting with other agents in a multi-agents based environment. In this research, cognitive awareness identifies the ability of the web agents to diagnose their processing limitations and to establish interactions with the external environment. The outcome is the enhanced flexibility, reusability and predictability of the agent behaviour; thus contributing towards minimizing human cognitive demands. The concept of cognitive profiling presented in this paper considers the semantic web as an action mediating space, where ontological models provide affordances for improving cognitive awareness through shared knowledge-base. The conceptual model for the cognitive profile architecture is developed with Protege Ontology editor to generate OWL Ontology and evaluated through a proof of concept. The results show that agents equipped with cognitive awareness can undertake complex tasks more dynamically.", "paper_title": "Multi-agent collaboration based on enhanced cognitive awareness: an architecture for agents' profiling on the semantic web", "paper_id": "WOS:000297983500005"}
