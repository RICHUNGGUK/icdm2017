This is achieved by tracking the dynamics of the mixing parameter within a hybrid filter rather than the actual filter performance. An implementation of the proposed hybrid filter using a combination of the Least Mean Square (LMS) and the Generalised Normalised Gradient Descent (GNGD) algorithms is analysed and the potential of such a scheme for tracking signal nonlinearity is highlighted. Simulations on linear and nonlinear signals in a prediction configuration support the analysis. Biological applications of the approach have been illustrated on EEG data of epileptic patients.", "paper_title": "An online method for detecting nonlinearity within a signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100154"}
