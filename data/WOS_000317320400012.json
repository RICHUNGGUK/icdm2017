We propose a symbolic-numerical method that, starting from the knowledge of X and epsilon, determines a polynomial f whose degree is strictly bounded by the minimal degree of the elements of the vanishing ideal of X. Then, in Theorem 4.3, we state the sufficient conditions for proving that Z(f) lies close to each point of X by less than epsilon. The validity of the proposed method relies on a combination of classical results of Computer Algebra and Numerical Analysis; its effectiveness is illustrated with a number of examples.
