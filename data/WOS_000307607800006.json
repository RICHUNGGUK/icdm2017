In this article, we introduce the first algorithm that reduces sensor coverage redundancy through joint Sensor Activation and sensing Radius Adaptation (SARA) in general application scenarios comprising two classes of devices: sensors with variable sensing radius and sensors with fixed sensing radius. This device heterogeneity is explicitly addressed by modeling the coverage problem through Voronoi-Laguerre diagrams that, differently from Voronoi diagrams, allow for correctly identifying each sensor coverage region depending on the sensor current radius and the radii of its neighboring nodes. SARA executes quickly with guaranteed termination and, given the currently available nodes, it always guarantees maximum coverage. By means of extensive simulations, we show that SARA obtains remarkable improvements with respect to previous solutions, ensuring, in networks with heterogeneous nodes, longer network lifetime and wider coverage.", "paper_title": "Sensor Activation and Radius Adaptation (SARA) in Heterogeneous Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307607800006"}
