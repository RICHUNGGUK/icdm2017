Compared with a desktop computer, the operation system of this system (Windows CE) is greatly different in many aspects ofsystem development and design. Key technologies investigated included geographic information system (GIS), spatial access methods, database technology on Windows CE and sampling control plan. Considering the uniqueness of farms, an object-oriented farm model was developed to describe farm objects properly, edit sampling plan conveniently, and perform sampling control easily. The system can be used with the global positioning system (GPS) and sensors to acquire and analyze field information instantly. Some examples are used to explain the use of the system. The development of the system supports fast collection and real-time processing of precision farming field information.
