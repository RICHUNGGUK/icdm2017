Using this form, a new symmetric eight-step predictor-corrector method with minimal phase-lag and algebraic order ten is also constructed. The new method is based on the multistep symmetric method of Quinlan-Tremaine,(1) with eight steps and 8th algebraic order and is constructed to solve numerically the radial time-independent Schrodinger equation. It can also be used to integrate related IVPs with oscillating solutions such as orbital problems. We compare the new method to some recently constructed optimized methods from the literature. We measure the efficiency of the methods and conclude that the new method with minimal phase-lag is the most efficient of all the compared methods and for all the problems solved.", "paper_title": "A NEW SYMMETRIC EIGHT-STEP PREDICTOR-CORRECTOR METHOD FOR THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE RADIAL SCHRODINGER EQUATION AND RELATED ORBITAL PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288566500004"}
