Our approach to simplify the tasks of constructing and customizing component-based digital libraries is based on an assistant tool: a setup wizard that segments those tasks into well-defined steps and drives the user along these steps. For generality purposes, the architecture of the wizard is based on the 5S framework and different wizard versions can be specialized according to the pool of components being configured. This paper describes the design and implementation of this wizard, as well as usability experiments designed to evaluate it.", "paper_title": "Design, implementation, and evaluation of a wizard tool for setting up component-based digital libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500012"}
