For obtaining a fixed ranging accuracy, the required NDB OFDM transmit energy is proven in this paper to be equal to 30% of the required NPS PN transmit energy, spending less nonrenewable resource, emitting smaller CO2 and indicating a \"green\" activity. Furthermore, the localization performance and the optimal network topology for obtaining the best accuracy are mathematically derived. By assuming a positioning system with the proposed optimal network topology, the positioning accuracy is derived, and the total energy saving is reported when using NDB OFDM transmission instead of NPS PN transmission. Numerical results and experimental measurements both show a consistency with our proposed theory.", "paper_title": "70% Energy Saving in Wireless Positioning Systems: Non-Data-Bearing OFDM Transmission Replaces Non-Pulse-Shaping PN Transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000356714100003"}
