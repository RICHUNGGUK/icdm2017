A linear matrix inequality (LMI) method for the design of a stabilizing fuzzy static output feedback guaranteed cost reliable controller is investigated, which provides different upper bounds On the guaranteed cost function for the normal case and actuator fault cases. A suboptimal fuzzy static output feedback guaranteed cost reliable Controller is given by means of a LMI optimization procedure, which not only provides different upper bounds on the guaranteed cost function for the normal case and actuator fault cases, but also provides an optimized upper bound on the guaranteed Cost function for the normal case. Finally, simulations on the continuous track-trailer system are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "FUZZY STATIC OUTPUT FEEDBACK GUARANTEED COST RELIABLE CONTROL FOR UNCERTAIN NONLINEAR SYSTEMS WITH TIME-DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000261409800029"}
