Inserting decoupling capacitors is one important and effective solution to improve the power integrity. The existing decoupling capacitor optimization approaches meet constraints on input impedance. In this paper, we show that impedance metric leads to large overdesign and then develop a noise-driven optimization algorithm for decoupling capacitors in packages for power integrity. We use the simulated annealing algorithm to minimize the total cost of decoupling capacitors under the constraints of a worst case noise bound. The key enabler for efficient optimization is an incremental worst case noise computation based on fast Fourier transform over incremental impedance matrix evaluation. Compared to the existing impedance-based approaches, our algorithm reduces the decoupling capacitor cost by 3x and is also more than 10x faster even with explicit noise computation.", "paper_title": "Efficient in-package decoupling capacitor optimization for I/O power integrity", "paper_id": "WOS:000245190500011"}
