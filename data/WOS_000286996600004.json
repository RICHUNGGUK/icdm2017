As a consequence, we show that Gelfond-Lifschitz operator can be viewed as a proof-theoretic concept. As an application, we find a propositional theory E(p) whose models are precisely stable models of programs. We also find a class of propositional theories C(P) with the following properties. Propositional models of theories in C(P) are precisely stable models of P, and the theories in C(T) are of the size linear in the size of P.", "paper_title": "Guarded resolution for Answer Set Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000286996600004"}
