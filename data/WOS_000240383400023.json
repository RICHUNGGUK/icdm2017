Transmit power control and clustering can reduce the energy consumption efficiently when nodes are non-homogeneously dispersed in space. This paper presents the clustering algorithm in wireless sensor networks. The clustering algorithm is based on the optimization of transmit power level by using the soft computing approaches. This solution determines the node transmit power level statistically and achieves energy savings efficiently.", "paper_title": "Clustering algorithm in wireless sensor networks using transmit power control and soft computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400023"}
