The descriptors are provided by applying a multiscale transform to the fractal dimension of the image estimated through the probability (Voss) method. The effectiveness of the descriptors is verified in a classification task using benchmark over texture datasets. The results obtained demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method as a tool for the description and discrimination of texture images.
