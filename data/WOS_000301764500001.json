Fuzzy coding (FC) provides the value of a variable on the basis of the optimum number of selected fuzzy sets and their effectiveness in terms of degree-of-membership. It is an indirect encoding method and has been shown to perform better than other conventional binary, Gray and floating-point encoding methods. However, the static range of the membership functions is a major problem in fuzzy coding, resulting in longer times to arrive at an optimum solution in large or complicated search spaces. This paper proposes a new algorithm, called fuzzy coding with a dynamic range (FCDR), which dynamically allocates the range of the variables to evolve an effective search region, thereby achieving faster convergence. Results are presented for two benchmark optimisation problems, and also for a case study involving neural identification of a highly non-linear pH neutralisation process from experimental data. It is shown that dynamic exploration of the genetic search region is effective for parameter optimisation in problems where the search space is complicated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
