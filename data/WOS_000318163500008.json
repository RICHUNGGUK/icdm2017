An eavesdropper also receives the transmitted signal via another MIMO channel. We first consider the discrete memoryless channel and obtain the capacity region of the degraded channel. The secret dirty paper coding (SDPC) region as an achievable rate region for the general discrete channel is introduced. Relying on the results for the discrete channel, we fully characterize the secrecy capacity region of MIMO broadcast channel. It is shown that the SDPC scheme is optimal. The converse part of the proof relies on the generalized Costa's entropy power inequality and a new channel enhancement strategy in which we only need to enhance the channels of the legitimate receivers, and the channel of the eavesdropper remains unchanged.", "paper_title": "The Secrecy Capacity Region of the Gaussian MIMO Broadcast Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500008"}
