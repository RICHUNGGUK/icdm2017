By an m-congruence succession, we will mean a pair of adjacent parts x and y within a composition such that x equivalent to y (mod m). Here, we consider the problem of counting the compositions of size n according to the number of m-congruence successions, extending recent results concerning successions on subsets and permutations. A general formula is obtained, which reduces in the limiting case to the known generating function formula for the number of Carlitz compositions. Special attention is paid to the case m = 2, where further enumerative results may be obtained by means of combinatorial arguments. Finally, an asymptotic estimate is provided for the number of compositions of size n having no m-congruence successions.", "paper_title": "Congruence successions in compositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000342623000020"}
