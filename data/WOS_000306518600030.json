We study two error metrics: Kendall's tau-metric, which applies to charge-constrained errors, and the l(infinity)-metric, which is useful in the case of limited-magnitude errors. In both cases, we construct snake-in-the-box codes with rate asymptotically tending to 1. We also provide efficient successor-calculation functions, as well as ranking and unranking functions. Finally, we also study bounds on the parameters of such codes.", "paper_title": "Snake-in-the-Box Codes for Rank Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306518600030"}
