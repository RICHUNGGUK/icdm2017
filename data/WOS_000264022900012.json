Moreover, the degree of attractiveness, defined in terms of the relative distance, exhibits a high degree of correlation with the average rating scores given by human assessors. These findings motivate a bi-prototype theory that relates facial attractiveness to the averages of attractive and unattractive faces rather than the average of all faces, as previously hypothesized by some researchers.", "paper_title": "A Bi-Prototype Theory of Facial Attractiveness", "paper_id": "WOS:000264022900012"}
