First, given a color image, we transform it in the YCbCr color space and apply the SPT transform on chrominance channels Cb and Cr, yielding a number of multi-scale and multi-oriented subbands. Then, we describe the texture in each SPT subband using LBP histograms. The histograms from each subband are concatenated to produce a feature vector. Finally, a support vector machine uses the feature vector to classify images into forged or authentic. The proposed method has been evaluated on three publicly available image databases. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over some recent other methods.", "paper_title": "Image forgery detection using steerable pyramid transform and local binary pattern", "paper_id": "WOS:000334447600011"}
