The only allowed charge-placement mechanism is a \"push-to-the-top\" operation, which takes a single cell of the set and makes it the top-charged cell. The resulting scheme eliminates the need for discrete cell levels, as well as overshoot errors, when programming cells. We present unrestricted Gray codes spanning all possible n-cell states and using only \"push-to-the-top\" operations, and also construct balanced Gray codes. One important application of the Gray codes is the realization of logic multilevel cells, which is useful in conventional storage solutions. We also investigate rewriting schemes for random data modification. We present both an optimal scheme for the worst case rewrite performance and an approximation scheme for the average-case rewrite performance.", "paper_title": "Rank Modulation for Flash Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000266878500019"}
