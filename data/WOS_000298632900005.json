We deal specifically with the situation in which the only constraint on the evader's velocity is a bound on speed (i.e., the evader is able to move omnidirectionally), and the pursuer is a nonholonomic, differential drive system having bounded speed. We formulate our problem as a game. Given the evader's maximum speed, we determine a lower bound for the required pursuer speed to track the evader. This bound allows us to determine at the beginning of the game whether or not the pursuer can follow the evader based on the initial system configuration. We then develop the system model, and obtain optimal motion strategies for both players, which allow us to establish the long term solution for the game. We present an implementation of the system model, and motion strategies, and also present simulation results of the pursuit-evasion game.", "paper_title": "Tracking an omnidirectional evader with a differential drive robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000298632900005"}
