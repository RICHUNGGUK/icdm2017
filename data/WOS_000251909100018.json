This paper studies one of the reasons for the fact that random primary input sequences achieve very low fault coverage for synchronous sequential circuits. It is shown that a synchronous sequential circuit may have input cubes, or incompletely specified input vectors, that synchronize a subset of its state variables, i.e., it forces them to certain specified values. When an input cube c that synchronizes the subset of state variables S(c) has a small number of specified inputs, the input vectors covered by it may appear often in a random primary input sequence. As a result, the sequence will force the same values on the state variables in S(c) repeatedly. This may limit the fault coverage that the sequence can obtain. To address this issue, a procedure is described for modifying a random primary input sequence to eliminate the appearance of input vectors that synchronize subsets of state variables. It is demonstrated that this procedure has a significant effect on the fault coverage that can lie achieved by random primary input sequences.", "paper_title": "Primary input vectors to avoid in random test sequences for synchronous sequential circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000251909100018"}
