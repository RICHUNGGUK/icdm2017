In summary, it can be observed that stenoses in an artery significantly influence the haemodynamic parameters of wall shear stress and pressure drop in contrast to dilatations case. This deduces that stenosis plays a more critical role in plaque growth and vulnerability in contrast to dilatation, and should be the key element in cardiovascular pathology and diagnosis. Through quantitative analysis of WSS and Delta P, we have provided a clearer insight into the haemodynamics of atherosclerotic arteries. Determination of these parameters can be helpful to cardiologists, because it is directly implicated in the genesis and development of atherosclerosis.", "paper_title": "Transient blood flow in elastic coronary arteries with varying degrees of stenosis and dilatations: CFD modelling and parametric study", "paper_id": "WOS:000349447600012"}
