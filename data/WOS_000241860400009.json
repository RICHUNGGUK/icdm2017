Role abstraction is provided with an exception interface through which the role members can perform exception handling actions. Exception handling involving multiple role members is also supported through interrole exception propagation mechanisms provided in the model.", "paper_title": "Exception handling in CSCW applications in pervasive computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241860400009"}
