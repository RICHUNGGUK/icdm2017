Temperature jumps due to the resistance at the interface between the two materials, as well as the discontinuous conductivity, require to be handled and to be treated in an appropriate way. We propose to solve the enthalpy equation locally in both components (in graphite and salt) where temperature is continuous, while a condensed problem is used to describe the discontinuity at the interface and it is solved by an iterative technique like GMRES algorithm.
