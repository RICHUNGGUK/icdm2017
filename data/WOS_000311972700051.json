In this paper, we present an easy to use sketch-based cloth modeling approach. Contours can be easily sketched on a mannequin to generate quad meshes to represent pieces of cloth already fitted and draped. Typically, the clothing process depends greatly on the meshing scheme that has to infer its geometry from the input boundary. Our quad meshing scheme is based on discrete Coons patches but with arbitrary boundary input. We also apply the permanence principle to our topological solution to allow more control over the influence of the input boundary polyline on the interior output polygonal mesh. This facilitates the creation of folds that are strongest in curvature at the boundary and which diminish towards the interior. The generated garments can then be easily animated in a simulation system based on finite elements, using a rediscretization of the generated mesh and a reconstructed metric of the cloth surface.
