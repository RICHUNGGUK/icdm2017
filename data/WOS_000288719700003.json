To assist decision making, each bidder is associated with a type of certification, namely shill, shill suspect, or trusted bidder, at the end of each auction's bidding cycle. The certification level is determined on the basis of a bidder's bidding behaviors including shilling behaviors and normal bidding behaviors, and thus fraudulent bidders can be identified. In this paper, we focus on representing knowledge about bidders from different aspects in online auctions, and reasoning on bidders' trustworthiness under uncertainties using Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide a case study using real auction data from eBay. The analysis results show that our approach can be used to detect shills effectively and efficiently. By applying Dempster-Shafer theory to combine multiple sources of evidence for shill detection, the proposed approach can significantly reduce the number of false positive results in comparison to approaches using a single source of evidence.", "paper_title": "REASONING UNDER UNCERTAINTY FOR SHILL DETECTION IN ONLINE AUCTIONS USING DEMPSTER-SHAFER THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000288719700003"}
