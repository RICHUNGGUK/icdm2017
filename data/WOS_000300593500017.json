The analytic models based method aims to use mathematical equations to address both multi-physic and economic characteristics of a product. The proposed approach is to convert the preliminary design problem into a global constrained optimization problem. The objective is to develop powerful optimization methods enough to handle complex analytical models. We propose to adapt an approach to solve this problem based on interval analysis, constraint propagation and model reformulation. In order to understand the optimization algorithm used for engineering design problems, some basic definitions and properties of interval analysis are introduced. Then, the basic optimization algorithms for both unconstrained and constrained problems are introduced and illustrated. The next section introduces the reformulation technique as main accelerating device. An application of the reformulation device and its global optimization algorithm on the optimal design of electrical actuators is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
