In this paper, we consider the problem of resource management based on security satisfaction ratio with fairness-aware in two-way relay networks. Multiple source nodes exchange information with the help of relay node in the presence of an eavesdropper, and diverse security requirements are taken into account with coexistence of security users and normal users. The joint problem of power allocation, and subchannel pairing and allocation aims to maximize the security satisfaction ratio for legitimate users subject to limited power and subchannel constraints. We model the security resource management problem as a mixed integer programming problem, which is decomposed into three subproblems, distributed power allocation, distributed subchannel allocation, and distributed subchannel pairing, and then solved it in constraint particle swarm optimization (CPSO), binary CPSO (B_CPSO), and classic Hungarian algorithm (CHA) method, respectively. Moreover, a suboptimal subchannel pairing algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational complexity compared with the CHA. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Resource Management Based on Security Satisfaction Ratio with Fairness-Aware in Two-Way Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358510900001"}
