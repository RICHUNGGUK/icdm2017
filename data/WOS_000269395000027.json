The uncertainties are assumed to be unknown but bounded. Second Moment stability for the uncertain DTFTCS driven by a state feedback control law is to be investigated. Sufficient conditions that guarantee the second,moment stability and achieve a minimum of delta-level of disturbance rejection are to be derived. An H(infinity) stabilizing fault tolerant control law will be synthesized as a feasible solution for a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which allow the utilization of linear optimization tools. The results are Verified by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "STABILIZATION OF DISCRETE FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH PARAMETER UNCERTAINTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000027"}
