However, the scale, complexity, and inherent resource sharing across workloads make the Cloud management for predictable performance difficult. As a first step towards designing Cloud based systems that achieve such performance and realize the service level objectives, we develop a scalable stochastic analytic model for performance quantification of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Cloud. Specifically, we model a class of IaaS Clouds that offer tiered services by configuring physical machines into three pools with different provisioning delay and power consumption characteristics. Performance behaviors in such IaaS Clouds are affected by a large set of parameters, e.g., workload, system characteristics and management policies. Thus, traditional analytic models for such systems tend to be intractable. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a multi-level interacting stochastic sub-models approach where the overall model solution is obtained iteratively over individual sub-model solutions. By comparing with a single-level monolithic model, we show that our approach is scalable, tractable, and yet retains high fidelity. Since the dependencies among the sub-models are resolved via fixed-point iteration, we prove the existence of a solution. Results from our analysis show the impact of workload and system characteristics on two performance measures: mean response delay and job rejection probability. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
