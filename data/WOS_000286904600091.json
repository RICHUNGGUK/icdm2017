The S-Chart framework is structured as a set of knowledge models and algorithms that can be instantiated to accomplish chart interpretation in all sorts of domains. The knowledge models are represented in three semantic levels and apply the concept of symbol grounding in order to map the representation primitives between the levels. The interpretation algorithms carry out the interaction between the high-level symbolic reasoning, and the low-level signal processing. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the S-Chart framework, we developed the InteliStrata system, an application in Geology for the semantic interpretation of gamma ray profiles. Using the developed application, we have interpreted the charts of two gamma ray profiles captured in petroleum exploration wells, indicating the position of stratigraphic sequences and maximum flooding surfaces. The results were compared with the interpretation produced by an experienced geologist using the same data input. The system carried out interpretation that were compatible with the geologist interpretation over the data. Our framework has the advantage of allowing the integration of existing domain ontologies with domain independent visual knowledge models and also the ability of grounding domain concepts in low-level data.
