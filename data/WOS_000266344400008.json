Fix k >= d + 2 >= 3 and let G be a family of k-element subsets of an n-element set that contains no d-simplex. We prove that if vertical bar G vertical bar >= (1 - o(1))(n-1 k-1), then there is a vertex x of G such that the number of sets in G omitting x is o(n(k-1)) (here o(1) -> 0 and n -> infinity). A similar result when n/k is bounded from above was recently proved ir. [10]. Our main result is actually stronger, and implies that if vertical bar G vertical bar > (1 + epsilon)(n-1 k-1) for any epsilon > 0 and n sufficiently large, then G contains d + 2 sets A, A(1),...,A(d+l) such that the A(i)s form a d-simplex, and A contains an element of boolean AND(j not equal i)A(j) for each i. This generalizes, in asymptotic form, a recent result of Vestraete and the first author [18], who proved it for d = 1, epsilon = 0 and n >= 2k.", "paper_title": "Simplex Stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000266344400008"}
