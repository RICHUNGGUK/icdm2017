NFCAC has been successfully applied in the control-related problems of neural networks. However, there is no discussion about the game knowledge sharing algorithm and location recognition based on NFCAC in cellular Ad Hoc networking. We firstly propose a novel multi-hop routing NFCAC which is suitable for cellular Ad Hoc networking and then propose the algorithm to integrate the functions of both multi-hop routing NFCAC and the topology space in the special scenario. The topology and power consumption of each Mobile Host (MH) can be optimized due to the minimum link occupation with the help of the algorithm. Simulation results show that the algorithm can give more control guarantee to the networks in the variable MH loads and transmission powers, and make the MHs stable to support multi-hops at the same time.
