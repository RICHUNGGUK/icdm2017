Then each pair of vertices has a distance in the weighted graph, and a Euclidean distance. The stretch factor of the embedded graph is defined as the maximum ratio of these two distances, over all We give upper and lower bounds on the stretch factor (holding asymptotically almost surely), and show that for not too close to 0 or 1, these bounds are the best possible in a certain sense. Our results imply that the stretch factor is bounded with probability tending to 1 if and only if tends to 0, answering a question of O'Rourke.", "paper_title": "On the Stretch Factor of Randomly Embedded Random Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000317129000012"}
