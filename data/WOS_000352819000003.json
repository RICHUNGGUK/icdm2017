A detailed syntax of GeoSpelling is proposed in this paper. A specification is defined as a sequence of operations on the skin model. The syntax is based on instructions used in computer programming language: call to functions and flow control by condition and loop. In GeoSpelling, the call to functions corresponds to the declaration of operations; loops make it possible to manage a set of features with rigor and conditions to select features from a set.", "paper_title": "Formal Language for GeoSpelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000352819000003"}
