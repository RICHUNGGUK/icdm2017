In this article we continue this line of investigation and show that Graver bases also enable to minimize quadratic and higher degree polynomial functions which lie in suitable cones. These cones always include all separable convex polynomials and typically more.", "paper_title": "The quadratic Graver cone, quadratic integer minimization, and extensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000311675700005"}
