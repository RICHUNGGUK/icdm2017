Aviation management systems are generally based on old proprietary disparate systems, so there is a growing need for a system which could act as a collaborative decision support system, where the same right data can be provided at the right time to the right users. This system would not only eliminate the need to manually retrieve required information from multiple systems and reduce the possibility of human error, it would also allow the discovery of any hidden knowledge, a task otherwise not possible from separate systems. This paper presents our proposed approach to build an integrated system for data-intensive collaborative decision support. Each stage in the proposed framework is explained, including a section on the performance evaluation of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "Moving towards a collaborative decision support system for aeronautical data", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600003"}
