In this paper, a computational model of collaborative product design is proposed to facilitate the management and coordination of the collaborative product design process. Based on this model, the system architecture of a multi-agent framework for collaborative design is discussed. A software prototype featured by flexibility, scalability, distributed decision-making, and etc., is now being developed.", "paper_title": "A multi-agent framework for collaborative product design", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100052"}
