Here we apply a pattern recognition based approach to identify the genes those are severely over or under expressed in the allergen samples. The methodology involves clustering on gene expression and fold values followed by determining similarity/dissimilarity among various clusters, and measuring the extent of over/under expression of genes. From this analysis we have identified several genes those have significantly changed their expression values for asthmatic condition, and have reported in the present article. Some of these observations are supported by some earlier investigations. Others have been stayed unnoticed so far, but may play crucial role in mediating the development of asthma.", "paper_title": "Identification of over and under expressed genes mediating allergic asthma", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800101"}
