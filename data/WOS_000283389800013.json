The AFTSMC. incorporating the fuzzy logic controller (FLC), the TSMC, and an adaptive scheme, is designed to retain the advantages of the TSMC while reducing the chattering The adaptive law is designed on the basis of the Lyapunov stability criterion The self-tuning parameters are adapted online to improve the performance of the fuzzy terminal sliding-mode controller (FTSMC) Thus. it does not require detailed system parameters for the presented AFTSMC The simulation results demonstrate that the MIMO AFTSMC can provide a reasonable tracking performance (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "MIMO adaptive fuzzy terminal sliding-mode controller for robotic manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000283389800013"}
