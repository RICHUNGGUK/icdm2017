Home network is exposed to various cyber attacks of internet, involving hacking, malicious codes, worms, viruses, DoS attacks, and eavesdropping since it is connected to internet. So in this paper, we propose a new specification for security policy on home network for guaranteeing reliability and availability including authentication, authorisation and security policy deployment.", "paper_title": "Security policy specification for home network", "paper_id": "WOS:000271921100007"}
