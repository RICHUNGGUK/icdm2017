One critical factor that contributes to a distinct advantage of network coding in a dynamic network circumstance is the existence of a perfect feedback scheme. The current feedback schemes for network coding require special conditions to operate. However, the conditions are extremely hard to meet in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective feedback scheme, orthogonal coded feedback (OCF), in order to avoid the defects of the existing feedback schemes for network coding. Based on our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate orthogonal coding over a finite field into network coding for addressing problems of feedback in network coding diagrams. We establish a simple mathematical model for the feedback scheme, and a thorough analysis has been conducted based on the proposed model. Moreover, we design a simple code generating algorithm for orthogonal coding that can be used in any finite field. Our extensive simulations indicate that the proposed OCF outperforms the current feedback schemes in various network topologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
