Accurate reference metadata extraction from such publications is essential for the integration of metadata. from heterogeneous reference sources. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical template-based reference metadata extraction method for scholarly publications. We adopt a hierarchical knowledge representation framework called INFOMAP, which automatically extracts metadata. The experimental results show that, by using INFOMAP, we can extract author, title, journal, volume, number (issue), year, and page information from different kinds of reference styles with a high degree of precision. The overall average accuracy is 92.39% for the six major reference styles compared in this study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
