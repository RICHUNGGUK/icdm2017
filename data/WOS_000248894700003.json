Due to large data sets and narrow network bandwidth, general-purpose GIS can no longer visualize and manipulate these spatial data over networks in real time. This paper explores a way for building a Web-based 3D GIS application. The application aims to visualize and analyze large spatial data sets. We propose a novel 3D data model for representing the features of the terrain surface and 3D objects. A server-client architecture including progressive transmission methods and inultiresolution representations are presented to help create the application. Together with a spatial index, the application provides an effective way for powerful access and manipulation of large-scale data sets. Finally, an experiment is performed using the geo-data to verify that the application works appropriately. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
