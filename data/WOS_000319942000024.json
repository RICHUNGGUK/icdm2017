A user in a WMN may be covered by multiple APs, while it should be associated with only one to access the Internet. Conventional IEEE 802.11 user-AP association mechanism for WLANs employs signal strength as the sole metric. However, this may lead to network congestion and performance degradation in multi-hop networks such as WMNs, especially for multimedia services that require a large bandwidth and a low latency. Thus AP association in WMNs becomes an important research issue. In this paper we propose a novel AP association approach LBAA, taking AP's load-balancing, WMN's multi-hop characteristic, and user's RSSI into consideration. We first propose a centralized algorithm and then extend it to a distributed one, with the latter one more practical and convenient for deployment. Network throughput and max-min user fairness are improved by LBAA. Performance evaluation demonstrating the benefits of our approach is given through a series of experiments in terms of collision probability, access bandwidth, end-to-end throughput, and average RSSI.", "paper_title": "Load-balanced AP association in multi-hop wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319942000024"}
