In recent years, several Solutions have been devised to make DDM more efficient and adaptive to different traffic conditions. Examples of such systems include the Region-Based, Fixed Grid-Based, Hybrid, and Dynamic Grid-Based (DGB) schemes. However. less effort has been directed toward improving the processing performance of DDM techniques. This paper presents a novel DDM scheme called the Adaptive Dynamic Grid-Based (ADGB) scheme that optimizes DDM time through analysis of matching performance. ADGB uses an advertising scheme in which information about the target cell involved in the process of matching subscribers to publishers is known in advance. An important concept known as the Distribution Rate (DR) is devised. The distribution rate represents the relative processing load and communication load generated at each federate. The matching performance and the distribution rate are used as part of the ADGB method to select, throughout the simulation, the devised advertisement scheme that achieves the maximum gain with acceptable network traffic overhead. If we assume the same worst case propagation delays, when the matching probability is high, the performance estimation of ADGB has shown that a maximum efficiency gain of 66% can be achieved over the Dynamic Grid-Based scheme. The novelty of the ADGB scheme is its focus on improving performance. an important (and often forgotten) goal of DDM strategies. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
