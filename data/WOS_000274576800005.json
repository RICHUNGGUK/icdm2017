It was designed for use in high energy physics but its rich structure and ease of use lends itself well to the routine computations required in General Relativity. Here we will present a series of simple examples showing how Cadabra may be used, including verifying that the Levi-Civita connection is a metric connection and a derivation of the Gauss equation between induced and ambient curvatures.
