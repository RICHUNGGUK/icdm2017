Cognitive radio has emerged as a promising solution for efficient radio spectrum utilization. One of the most important techniques of CR is spectrum sensing, which provides the real-time occupancy of available frequency bands for secondary users. However, current CR frameworks require SU terminals to conduct spectrum sensing and upload their sensing results to a fusion center (FC). This approach leads to many architectural challenges such as high design complexity, increase in hardware costs, inefficient resource usage, and high energy consumption. To address these challenges, we present a novel CR spectrum sensing framework by introducing a new functional entity called the spectrum agent (SA) to perform spectrum sensing tasks for SUs. We describe in detail the architecture and spectrum sensing mechanism of this new framework which provides a seamless integration of CR with next-generation (5G) cellular networks.", "paper_title": "COGNITIVE RADIO SPECTRUM SENSING FRAMEWORK BASED ON MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE FOR 5G NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000367729400006"}
