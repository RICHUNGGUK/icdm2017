This paper presents a comprehensive study on state of art of power factor corrected single-phase AC-DC converters configurations, control strategies, selection of components and design considerations, performance evaluation, power quality considerations, selection criteria and potential applications, latest trends, and future developments. Simulation results as well as comparative performance are presented and discussed for most of the proposed topologies.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Study of Single-Phase AC-DC Power Factor Corrected Converters With High-Frequency Isolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000296728600002"}
