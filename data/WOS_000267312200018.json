One of the two competing firms adopts best-reply behaviour, whereas the other adjusts its production according to the gradient of its profit. Although excessive reaction of the latter firm generally results in destabilization of the 'Cournot-Nash' equilibrium and brings about complex dynamic scenarios, this occurs via qualitatively different bifurcation routes, depending on the ratio between firms' marginal costs. The paper also provides a preliminary exploration of the long-run sustainability of the heterogeneous duopoly competition, by investigating numerically the impact of fixed costs on firms' survival, along different output trajectories.
