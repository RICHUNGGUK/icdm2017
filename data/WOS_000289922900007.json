The QSAR model is described inaccurately by the traditional multiple linear regression (MLR) model for the substitution of CENUs at N-3, whose characteristics play key roles in the biological activity. A nonlinear QSAR study is undertaken by a three-layered NN model, using molecular descriptors that are known to be responsible for the antitumor activity to optimize the input variables of the MLR model. The results demonstrate that NN models present the relationship between antitumor activity and molecular descriptors clearly, and they yield predictions in excellent agreement with the experiment's obtained values (R(2) = 0.983). The R(2) value is 0.983 for the 5-8-1 NN model, compared with 0.506 for the MLR model, and the nonlinear model is able to account for 98.3% of the variance of antitumor activities.
