By combining floating-point chaotic computations with algebraic operations as well as local and global couplings, the system reaches high bit confusion and diffusion rates and thus desirable collision resistance with even one-iteration computation. The algorithm can be used to calculate hash values of 128, 160, 192, 256, 384 and 512 bits with little difference in performance for the different hash values. The algorithm has both strong collision resistance and high efficiency and can serve as a new type of candidate hash function in software. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
