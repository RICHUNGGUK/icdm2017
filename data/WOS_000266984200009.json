When optical bursts are transmitted all optically from source to destination, each wavelength conversion performed along the lightpath may cause some signal-to-noise deterioration. If the distortion of the signal quality becomes significant enough, the receiver would not be able to recover the original data. In this paper we examine the performance degradation when an upper bound on the number of wavelength conversions that a signal can go through is enforced. We refer to this constraint as conversion cascading constraint. We propose a novel proactive routing scheme under this constraint that considers the instantaneous link congestion at the moment when the bursts arrive. It has three major advantages: (1) utilize the same offset times for the same node pairs while providing dynamic routing without using any fiber delay lines (FDL); (2) decrease burst loss probability to a great extent; (3) mitigate unfairness among the bursts with different hop counts, which is even worse under the conversion cascading constraint if without any special treatment. We also extend the proposed mechanism to embrace a variant of regulated deflection routing which can further improve network performance.", "paper_title": "Addressing conversion cascading constraint in OBS networks through proactive routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000266984200009"}
