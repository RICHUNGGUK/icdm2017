The main difference between other estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) and this new method-known as Evolutionary Bayesian Classifier-based Optimization Algorithms (EBCOAs)-is the way the fitness function is taken into account, as a new variable, to generate the probabilistic graphical model that will be applied for sampling the next population. We also present experimental results to compare performance of this new method with other methods of the evolutionary computation field like evolution strategies, and EDAs. Results obtained show that this new approach can at least obtain similar performance as these other paradigms.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary Bayesian classifier-based optimization in continuous domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300067"}
