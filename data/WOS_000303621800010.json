In response to that necessity, the researchers from the Infobotica Research Group, in cooperation with a group of companies and universities, have proposed a new open standard and architecture. It is composed of different virtual services, protocols as well as an open adapters' architecture, on top of the UPnP protocol stack. The proposed application protocols and the general architecture provide a communication environment for positioning devices, rules compliance checks, the collaboration between devices and managing energy efficiently. The different tools, adapters, and protocols, developed within the DHCompliant architecture, have defined a new level of application protocol that has allowed increased integration of those modules into home automation, improving their interoperability, and allowing the addition of new services to the same standard and commercial hardware.
