A fuzzy decision system built from the characteristics of the HVS is proposed to classify pixels of the input image into human perception nonsensitive class and sensitive class. Bilinear interpolation is used to interpolate the nonsensitive regions and a neural network is proposed to interpolate the sensitive regions along edge directions. High-resolution digital images along with supervised learning algorithms are used to automatically train the proposed neural network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed new resolution enhancement algorithm can produce a higher visual quality for the interpolated image than the conventional interpolation methods.", "paper_title": "An HVS-Directed neural-network-based image resolution enhancement scheme for image resizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000248703700007"}
