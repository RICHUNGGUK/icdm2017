Then on the condition that the profit value of any coalition is not fully used to allocate, a generalized interval cooperative game and its solution concepts, such as generalized interval core, generalized interval dominance core are proposed. Further more, some extended theorems to discuss the existence and the relations about its solution concepts are developed. Finally, by a specific example, the reasonableness and validity of the above theoretical notions are verified.", "paper_title": "Solutions for generalized interval cooperative games", "paper_id": "WOS:000351140600008"}
