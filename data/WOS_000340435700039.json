This ANFISITS control system is composed of an ANFIS controller and an ITS controller. The ANFIS controller is designed to approach an ideal controller and the ITS controller is designed to compensate for the approximation error between the ANFIS controller and the ideal controller; meanwhile, the ANFISITS control can cope with the disturbances. In simulations, the chaotic system control is illustrated to verify this proposed ANFISITS control system. The simulation results of the proposed control method possess better performance and robustness compared with that of fuzzy sliding parallel distributed compensation (FS-PDC) control.", "paper_title": "ANFIS-based integral terminal sliding mode control for disturbed chaotic system", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700039"}
