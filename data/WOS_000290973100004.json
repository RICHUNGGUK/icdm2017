Properly abstracting the distributed data with a compact representation which can retain sufficient local details for global knowledge discovery in principle can address both the scalability and the data privacy challenges. This calls for the need to develop formal methodologies to support knowledge discovery on abstracted data. In this paper, we propose to abstract distributed data as Gaussian mixture models and learn a family of generative models from the abstracted data using a modified EM algorithm. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we applied it to learn (a) data cluster models and (b) data manifold models, and evaluated their performance using both synthetic and benchmark data sets with promising results in terms of both effectiveness and scalability. Also, we have demonstrated that the proposed approach is robust against heterogeneous data distributions over the distributed sources.
