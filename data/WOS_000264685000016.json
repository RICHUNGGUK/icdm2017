The method is based on a variational moving mesh PDE for the phase function, coupled with efficient semi-implicit treatments for advancing the mesh function, the phase function and the velocity and pressure in a decoupled manner. Ample numerical results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the moving mesh spectral method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
