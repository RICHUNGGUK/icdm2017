This architectural feature supports higher memory bandwidth by allowing multiple data memory accesses to occur in parallel. Exploiting dual memory banks, however, is a challenging problem for compilers. This, in part, is due to the instruction-level parallelism, small numbers of registers, and highly specialized register capabilities of most DSPs. In this paper, we present a new methodology based on a genetic algorithm for assigning data to dual-bank memories. Our approach is global, and integrates several important issues in memory assignment within a single model. Special effort is made to identify those data objects that could potentially benefit from an assignment to a specific memory, or perhaps duplication in both memories. As part of our experimentation, we compare the effectiveness of three different repair heuristics which consist in transforming infeasible solutions into feasible ones. Our computational results show that when using the most effective repair method, the GA is able to achieve a 54% reduction in the number of memory cycles and a reduction in the range of 7 to 42% in the total number of cycles when tested with well-known DSP kernels and applications.", "paper_title": "Assigning data to dual memory banks in DSPs with a genetic algorithm using a repair heuristic", "paper_id": "WOS:000243601900005"}
