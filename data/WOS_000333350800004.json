Lots of attempts have been made to address this problem through experiments and simulations. This paper analyzes the TCP incast problem in data centers by focusing on the relationships between the TCP throughput and the congestion control window size of TCP. The root cause of the TCP incast problem is explored and the essence of the current methods to mitigate the TCP incast is well explained. The rationality of our analysis is verified by simulations. The analysis as well as the simulation results provides significant implications to the TCP incast problem. Based on these implications, an effective approach named IDTCP (Incast Decrease TCP) is proposed to mitigate the TCP incast problem. Analysis and simulation results verify that our approach effectively mitigates the TCP incast problem and noticeably improves the TCP throughput.", "paper_title": "IDTCP: An effective approach to mitigating the TCP incast problem in data center networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333350800004"}
