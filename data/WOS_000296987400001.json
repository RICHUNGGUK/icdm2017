A word has period p if its letters at distance p match. The exponent of a nonempty word is the quotient of its length over its smallest period. In this article we give some new results on the trade-off between the number of squares and the number of maximal-exponent powers in infinite binary words, in the three cases where the maximal exponent is 7/3, 5/2, and 3. These are the only threshold values related to the question. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
