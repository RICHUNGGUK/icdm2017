Using the Hamacher and Frank t-norm, we propose a parametric log-ratio model, which is a generalization of the log-ratio model and is more flexible in algorithmic development. We develop a generalized linear contrast enhancement algorithm based on the proposed parametric log-ratio model. We show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is effective and robust for different types of images.", "paper_title": "Parametric Generalized Linear System Based on the Notion of the t-Norm", "paper_id": "WOS:000321924600031"}
