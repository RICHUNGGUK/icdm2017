The concepts of normal consistency and almost inconsistency of theories in the above-mentioned logic systems are introduced, and sufficient and necessary conditions for theories being normal consistent or almost inconsistent are given. Finally, comparison with the existing concept of consistency degrees of theories is analyzed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
