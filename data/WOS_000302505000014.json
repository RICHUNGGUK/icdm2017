This is a, major open problem in the area of denotational semantics of probabilistic higher-order languages. We relax the question, and look for quasi-continuous depos instead. We introduce a natural class of such quasi-continuous depos, the omega-QRB-domains. We show that they form a, category omega-QRB with pleasing properties: omega-QRB is closed under the probabilistic powerdomain functor, under finite products, under taking bilimits of expanding sequences, under retracts, and even under so-called quasi-retracts. But... omega-QRB is not Cartesian closed. We conclude by showing that the QRB domains are just one half of an FS-domain, merely lacking control.", "paper_title": "QRB-DOMAINS AND THE PROBABILISTIC POWERDOMAIN", "paper_id": "WOS:000302505000014"}
