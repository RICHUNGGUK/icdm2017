Many anticancer drugs have been proved effective against cancer cells as well as toxic to human tissues, which prevents sufficient doses from being administered to obtain a complete cure. In this paper we build an optimal control model to optimize the scheduling problem along one cycle of chemotherapy treatment using a single anticancer drug etoposide (VP-16). In the model, three mathematic models are adopted to mimic physiological response of body under chemotherapy: (i) Pharmacokinetic model of anticancer drug; (ii) A two-compartment tumor growth dynamic model under the influence of cell-cycle-specific anticancer drugs; and (iii) A semi-mechanistic model for myelosuppression. In this new integrated model clinically relevant objectives are proposed to gain a trade-off between efficacy and toxicity. Simulation results of clinical protocols are consistent with real-life clinical data. Furthermore, we find a new optimal drug regimen which can improve the efficacy without the risk of severe toxicity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
