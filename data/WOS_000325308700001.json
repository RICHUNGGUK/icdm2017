If T can be read only one character at the time the best known bounds are O (n root klogk) and O(n + n root k/w logk) in the word-RAM model with word length w. In the RAM models (including AC(0) and word-RAM) it is possible to read up to left perpendicularw/log sigma right perpendicular characters in constant time if the characters of T are encoded using inverted right perpendicularlog sigma inverted left perpendicular bits. The only solution for k-mismatches in packed text works in O ((n log sigma/log n) inverted right perpendicularm log(k + logn/log sigma)/winverted left perpendicular + n(epsilon)) time, for any epsilon > 0. We present an algorithm that runs in time O(n/left perpendicularw/(m log sigma)right perpendicular (1 + log min(k, sigma)log m/log sigma)) in the AC(0) model if m = O (w/log sigma) and T is given packed. We also describe a simpler variant that runs in time O(n/left perpendicular/(m log sigma)right perpendicular log min(m, log w/log sigma)) in the word-RAM model. The algorithms improve the existing bound for w = Omega(log(1+epsilon) n), for any epsilon > 0. Based on the introduced technique, we present algorithms for several other approximate matching problems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
