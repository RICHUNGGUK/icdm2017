However, most of the blind decoding schemes suffer from the oracle problem where an adversary may obtain useful information, such as the signature of a message, by interacting with the documents' owner (the oracle) using tricky requests. In this paper, a secure blind decoding scheme based on RSA scheme is proposed. Its security against one more decoding key and oracle attacks is formally proved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
