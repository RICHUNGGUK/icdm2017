Based on right coprime factorization to (sA - I)(-1) B, explicit solutions to the equation AXF - X = BY are proposed and thus explicit solutions to the former three types of matrix equations can be immediately established. With the special structure of the proposed solutions, necessary conditions to the nonsingularity of matrix X are also obtained. The proposed solutions give an ultimate and unified formula for the explicit solutions to these four types of linear matrix equations. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
