This study shows how an adaptive approach can be used to enhance the efficiency of the coordination process of an industrial supply chain. The result is a new adaptive method (called the adaptive discrepancy search), intended for search in nonbinary trees, and that is exploitable in a distributed optimization context. For the industrial case studied (a supply chain in the forest products industry), this allowed reducing nearly half the time needed to obtain the best solution in comparison with a standard nonadaptive method. The method has also been evaluated for use with synthesized problems in order to validate the results that are obtained and to illustrate different properties of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Supply Chain Coordination Using an Adaptive Distributed Search Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000312885400024"}
