Because there are multiple frequency components overlapping seriously in the radar echoes from walking humans, it is a very difficult work to recognize walking humans based on radar echoes. In this paper, a recognition method of walking humans based on radar m-D signatures is proposed. In this method, the m-D spectrum is generated by generalized S transform first, and then the entropy segmentation is used to segment the interesting region from the original spectrum. Next, the m-D features are extracted from the m-D region. Lastly, the support vector machine is used to recognize different walking human targets. The simulation experiments considering two factors of height and velocity are also conducted to test the performance of this proposed method.", "paper_title": "Multiple walking human recognition based on radar micro-Doppler signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000368790400002"}
