This model includes Windows-based and Geographical Information System-based programs for analyzing and modeling planform migration of streams. In the past, several rivers have been channelized causing environmental and ecological problems. Restoration techniques evolve as natural solutions to channelization, therefore, the prediction of planform migration in rivers is indispensable for economic and social reasons such as development of urban areas close to rivers, prevention of damages to infrastructure, reduction of agricultural land losses, and for the maintenance of biological diversity in rivers. Abad and Garcia [2004, Conceptual and mathematical model for evolution of meandering rivers in naturalization processes. On CD-ROM of Proceedings of Joint Conference on Water Resources Engineering and Water Resources Planning and Management, ASCE, June 27-July 1, Salt Lake City, Utah, 10pp.] presented a conceptual and mathematical model for evolution of meandering rivers that can be used in restoration and naturalization processes. In this work, the description of RVR Meander is based on the computational characteristics and applicability rather than presenting its theoretical basis. RVR Meander is an object oriented user-friendly model for restoration purposes. Two modules are included: statistical analysis and planform migration of rivers. This model has been successfully tested on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0/.2000/XP and on ArcMap 8.1/8.2/8.3. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
