In this system, a software agent incorporated into the tablet device performs dialogic interactions with users based on the concept of human-agent interaction (HAI) to (i) reduce their psychological resistance to the system; (ii) maintain their interest in the game; and (iii) improve the motivation for users to play the game long term. The difficulty level of the game is adjusted through reinforcement learning algorithms depending on the proficiency of respective users. Several experiments and subjective evaluations by older adults were conducted to evaluate the basic characteristics of the system, and to investigate the impact of the system on cognitive function. The ultimate goal of the proposed system is to establish an environment in which users can continuously engage in dementia-prevention activities without getting bored.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Training System for Dementia Prevention Using Memory Game Based on the Concept of Human-Agent Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000370191300002"}
