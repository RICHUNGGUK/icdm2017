This paper aims to examine emotional experiences that internet users gain while reading blogs, that is, assesses the attitude of blog readers through their subjective experiences within the communication process. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical survey is used to test the hypotheses. The sample is 349 users who browse blogs frequently. Data are analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) to understand the cause and effect of the entire model and to determine the goodness of fit of the conceptual model. Findings - Empirical results demonstrate that: interpersonal interaction enhances browsers, aesthetic experiences as well as playfulness; machine interaction generates high aesthetics value which comprises visual and entertainment effects, service excellence, and CROI; perceived similarity by readers positively influences the four components of customer experiential value; and a positive correlation exists between user attitudes toward reading blogs and their experiential value in aesthetics, playfulness, and service excellence. Practical implications - The findings will help bloggers understand the factors key to success and allocate the appropriate resources to operate a blog and achieve success. Originality/value - The value of this study is to establish the importance of customer experiential value theory. Previous research on customer experiential value primarily focuses on analysing consumer shopping behaviours and mostly on the utilitarian value of products. This research focuses on inner pleasure gained through reading blogs, such as aesthetic experiences and emotional reactions.", "paper_title": "The acceptance of blogs: using a customer experiential value perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000272529200003"}
