Segre, and this term is used here to denote a set of points H such that every line l meets H in half of the points of l. If one takes the point-line geometry on the points of the hemisystem, then one obtains a partial quadrangle and hence a strongly regular point graph. The only previously known hemisystems of generalised quadrangles of order (q, q (2)) were those of the elliptic quadric Q(-)(5, q) , q odd. We show in this paper that there exists a hemisystem of the Fisher-Thas-Walker-Kantor generalised quadrangle of order (5, 5(2)), which leads to a new partial quadrangle. Moreover, we can construct from our hemisystem the 3 . A (7)-hemisystem of Q-(5, 5), first constructed by Cossidente and Penttila.", "paper_title": "A hemisystem of a nonclassical generalised quadrangle", "paper_id": "WOS:000263300500005"}
