The compressible Euler and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using a higher-order (>2) finite volume method on unstructured grids. A sliding mesh approach is employed at the interface between computational grids in relative motion. In order to prevent loss of accuracy, two distinct families of higher-order sliding mesh interfaces are developed. These approaches fit naturally in a high-order finite volume framework. To this end, Moving Least Squares (MIS) approximants are used for the transmission of the information from one grid to another. A particular attention is paid for the study of the accuracy and conservation properties of the numerical scheme for static and rotating grids. The capabilities of the present solver to compute complex unsteady vortical flow motions created by rotating geometries are illustrated on a cross-flow configuration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
