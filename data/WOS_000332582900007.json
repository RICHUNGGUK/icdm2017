This problem can be regarded as a natural generalization of the global, local, and node-to-area edge-connectivity augmentation problems. In this paper, we show that there exists a constant c such that the problem is inapproximable within a ratio of , unless P=NP, even restricted to the directed global node-to-area edge-connectivity augmentation or undirected local node-to-area edge-connectivity augmentation. We also provide an -approximation algorithm for the area-to-area edge-connectivity augmentation problem, which is a natural extension of Kortsarz and Nutov's algorithm (Kortsarz and Nutov, J. Comput. Syst. Sci., 74:662-670, 2008). This together with the negative result implies that the problem is -approximable, unless P=NP, which solves open problems for node-to-area edge-connectivity augmentation in Ishii et al. (Algorithmica, 56:413-436, 2010), Ishii and Hagiwara (Discrete Appl. Math., 154:2307-2329, 2006), Miwa and Ito (J. Oper. Res. Soc. Jpn., 47:224-243, 2004). Furthermore, we characterize the node-to-area and area-to-area edge-connectivity augmentation problems as the augmentation problems with modulotone and k-modulotone functions.", "paper_title": "Augmenting Edge-Connectivity between Vertex Subsets", "paper_id": "WOS:000332582900007"}
