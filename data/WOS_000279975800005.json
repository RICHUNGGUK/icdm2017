DINUS allows arbitrary knot intervals on the edges, allows incorporation of special features, and provides limit point as well as limit normal rules. It is the first subdivision scheme that gives the user all this flexibility and at the same time all essential limit information, which is important for applications in modeling and adaptive rendering. DINUS is also amenable to analysis techniques for stationary schemes. We implemented DINUS as an Autodesk Maya plugin to show several modeling and rendering examples.", "paper_title": "DINUS: Double Insertion, Nonuniform, Stationary Subdivision Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000279975800005"}
