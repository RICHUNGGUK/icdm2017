A new training algorithm developed from combined concepts of swarm intelligence and quantum principles is presented. The training algorithm is called particle swarm optimization with quantum infusion (PSO-QI). To improve the effectiveness of learning, a two-step learning approach is introduced in the training. The objective of the learning in the first step is to find the optimal set of weights in the SRN considering all output errors. In the second step, the objective is to maximize the learning of each output dynamics by fine tuning the respective SRN output weights. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSO-QI training algorithm and the two-step learning approach, two examples of an SRN learning MIMO systems are presented. The first example is learning a benchmark MIMO system and the second one is the design of a wide area monitoring system for a multimachine power system. From the results, it is observed that SRNs can effectively learn MIMO systems when trained using the PSO-QI algorithm and the two-step learning approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
