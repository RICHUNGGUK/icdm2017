In particular we show that fidelity is bounded from above by a simple to compute quantity we call super-fidelity. It is analogous to another quantity called sub-fidelity. For any two states of a two-dimensional quantum system (N = 2) all three quantities coincide. We demonstrate that sub- and super-fidelity are concave functions. We also show that super-fidelity is super-multiplicative while sub-fidelity is sub-multiplicative and design feasible schemes to measure these quantities in an experiment. Super-fidelity can be used to define a distance between quantum states. With respect to this metric the set of quantum states forms a part of a N(2) - 1 dimensional hypersphere.", "paper_title": "SUB- AND SUPER-FIDELITY AS BOUNDS FOR QUANTUM FIDELITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000261782200007"}
