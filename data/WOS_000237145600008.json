These sets are provably not complete under the usual many-one reductions. Let R-C, R-Kt, R-KS, R-KT be the sets of strings x having complexity at least | x|/ 2, according to the usual Kolmogorov complexity measure C, Levin's time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity Kt [ L. Levin, Inform. and Control, 61 ( 1984), pp. 15 - 37], a space-bounded Kolmogorov measure KS, and a new time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity measure KT, respectively. Our main results are as follows: 1. R-KS and R-Kt are complete for PSPACE and EXP, respectively, under P/poly-truth-table reductions. Similar results hold for other classes with PSPACE-robust Turing complete sets. 2. EXP = NP(R)Kt. 3. PSPACE = ZPP(R)KS subset of P-RC. 4. The Discrete Log, Factoring, and several lattice problems are solvable in (BPPKT)-K-R. Our hardness result for PSPACE gives rise to fairly natural problems that are complete for PSPACE under <= (p)(T) reductions, but not under <= m(l)(og) reductions. Our techniques also allow us to show that all computably enumerable sets are reducible to R-C via P/poly-truth-table reductions. This provides the first \"efficient\" reduction of the halting problem to R-C.", "paper_title": "Power from random strings", "paper_id": "WOS:000237145600008"}
