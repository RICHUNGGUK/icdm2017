The Student Models (SMs) should not only represent the student's knowledge, but rather they should reflect, as faithfully as possible, the student's reasoning process. To facilitate this goal, in this article a new approach to student modeling is proposed that benefits from the advantages of Ontological Engineering, advancing in the pursue of a more granular and complete knowledge representation. It's focused, mainly, on the SM cognitive diagnosis process, and we present a method providing a rich diagnosis about the student's knowledge state - especially, about the state of learning objectives reached or not. The main goal is to achieve SMs with a good adaptability to the student's features and a high flexibility for its integration in varied ITSs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
