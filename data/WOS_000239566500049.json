We provide a definition of context, the relationship between context and knowledge and the importance of communication both as a means for the building of context as well as the end achieved by the context. We then propose a model of user context and demonstrate its application in a photo retrieval application. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of the context-aware media retrieval over other media retrieval approaches especially relevance feedback.", "paper_title": "Context-aware media retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500049"}
