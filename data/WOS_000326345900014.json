Ensemble-based stream mining leverages multiple classification models to achieve highly accurate anomaly detection in such streams, even when the stream is unbounded, evolving, and unlabeled. This makes the approach effective for identifying insider threats who attempt to conceal their activities by varying their behaviors over time. This paper applies ensemble-based stream mining, supervised and unsupervised learning, and graph-based anomaly detection to the problem of insider threat detection. It demonstrates that the ensemble-based approach is significantly more effective than traditional single-model methods, supervised learning outperforms unsupervised learning, and increasing the cost of false negatives correlates to higher accuracy. Future work will consider a wider range of tunable parameters in an effort to further reduce false positives, include a more sophisticated polling algorithm for weighting better models, and implement parallelization to lower runtimes to more rapidly detect emerging insider threats.", "paper_title": "EVOLVING INSIDER THREAT DETECTION STREAM MINING PERSPECTIVE", "paper_id": "WOS:000326345900014"}
