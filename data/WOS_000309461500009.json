The SD style characters are widely used, and can be seen in many anime, CG movies, or games. However, to create an SD model often requires professional skills and considerable time and effort. In this paper, we present a novel technique to generate an SD style counterpart of a normal 3D character model. Our approach uses an optimization guided by a number of constraints that can capture the properties of the SD style. Users can also customize the results by specifying a small set of parameters related to the body proportions and the emphasis of the signature characteristics. With our technique, even a novel user can generate visually pleasing SD models in seconds.", "paper_title": "SD Models: Super-Deformed Character Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000309461500009"}
