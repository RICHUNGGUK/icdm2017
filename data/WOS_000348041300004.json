Compared with the traditional fractional derivative, the coefficients of FDD along the eight directions in the image plane are not the same, which can reflect different fractional change rates along different directions and is benefit to enlarge the differences among the image textures. Experiments show that the capability of nonlinearly enhancing texture details by FDD is more obvious than those by the traditional fractional derivative and integer-order differentiation operators Laplacian, Butterworth high-pass filter.", "paper_title": "Image enhancement based on fractional directional derivative", "paper_id": "WOS:000348041300004"}
