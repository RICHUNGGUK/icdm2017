We propose an algorithm for enumerating all maximal cliques based on researches of the complex network properties. A novel branch and bound strategy by considering the clustering coefficient of a vertex is proposed. Our algorithm runs with time O (d boolean AND 2*N*S) delay and in O (n + m) space. It requires O (n*D boolean AND 2) time as a preprocessing, where D, N, S, d denote the maximum degree of G, the number of maximal cliques, the size of the maximum clique, and the number of triangles of a vertex with degree D respectively. Finally, we apply our algorithm to the telecommunication customer-churn-prediction and the experimental results show that the application promotes the capabilities of the chum prediction system effectively.", "paper_title": "A new algorithm for enumerating all maximal cliques in complex network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200067"}
