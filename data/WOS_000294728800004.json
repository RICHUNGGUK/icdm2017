The behavioral approach to the algebraization of logics extends the applicability of the traditional methods of algebraic logic to a wider range of logical systems, possibly encompassing many-sorted languages and non-truth-functional phenomena. However, as one needs to work with behavioral congruences, matrix semantics are unsuited to the behavioral setting. In [5], a promising version of algebraic valuation semantics was proposed in order to fill in this gap. Herein, we define the class of valuations that should be canonically associated to a logic, and we show, by means of new meaningful bridge results, how it is related to the behaviorally equivalent algebraic semantics of a behaviorally algebraizable logic.", "paper_title": "Towards a Behavioral Algebraic Theory of Logical Valuations", "paper_id": "WOS:000294728800004"}
