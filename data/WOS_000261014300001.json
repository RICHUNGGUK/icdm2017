The method of undetermined coefficients Was used for this derivative approximation. It this note which is a sequel to the previous work, we provide a simple prescription for fixing the order of approximation of the required derivative. This procedure is based oil the comparison of the various errors of the discretization process. (C) 2008 Elsevier BY.
