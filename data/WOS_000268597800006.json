In addition, opportunistic spectrum access may also help realize the deployment of multiple overlaid sensor networks, and eliminate collision and excessive contention delay incurred by dense node deployment. Incorporating cognitive radio capability in sensor networks yields a new sensor networking paradigm (i.e., cognitive radio sensor networks). In this article the main design principles, potential advantages, application areas, and network architectures of CRSNs are introduced. The existing communication protocols and algorithms devised for cognitive radio networks and WSNs are discussed along with the open research avenues for the realization of CRSNs.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268597800006"}
