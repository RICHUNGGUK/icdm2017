For the sake of improving the self-adaptability of resource management and accelerating the application and development of Computational Grid, an evaluating model of a computational grid node's QOS is put forward which is based on the whole running conditions and the execution results of computational grid jobs on the node. Applied in NPU Campus Computational Grid, this model achieves good effect.", "paper_title": "A QOS evaluating model for computational grid nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100060"}
