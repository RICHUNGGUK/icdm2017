However, many of the current social publicity strategies do not exploit all the potential of these mediums, since they obviate users' online life: the social contexts in which they are involved. Our proposal to reverse this situation is a model to infer users' social contexts by the application of several Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining techniques over users' interaction data on Facebook. We take advantage of both Facebook and Groupon APIs to provide a deployment scenario in which knowing users' social life allows ads to target the most potential customers, which is beneficial for both companies and possible customers.", "paper_title": "Inferring Contexts From Facebook Interactions: A Social Publicity Scenario", "paper_id": "WOS:000324765400007"}
