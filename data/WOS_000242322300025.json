Design/methodology/approach - Properties of rationalized Haar functions are first presented, and the operational matrix of the product of two rationalized Haar functions vector is utilized to reduce the computation of integro-differential equations to some algebraic equations. Findings - Numerical results support the theoretical results. Originality/value - Presents a method for solving integro-differential equations.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution of integro-differential equations by using rationalized Haar functions method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242322300025"}
