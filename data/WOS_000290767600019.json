A pop-up card is an interesting form of papercraft consisting of folded paper that forms a three-dimensional structure when opened. However, it is very difficult for the average person to design pop-up cards from scratch because it is necessary to understand the mechanism and determine the positions of objects so that pop-up parts do not collide with each other or protrude from the card. In the proposed system, the user interactively sets and edits primitives that are predefined in the system. The system simulates folding and opening of the pop-up card using a mass-spring model that can simply simulate the physical movement of the card. This simulation detects collisions and protrusions and illustrates the movement of the pop-up card. The results of the present study reveal that the user can design a wide range of pop-up cards using the proposed system.", "paper_title": "An interactive design system for pop-up cards with a physical simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290767600019"}
