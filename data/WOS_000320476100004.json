However, little research details the drivers of and obstacles to adoption of this technology. Institutional and organizational capability theory suggests an adoption model that accounts for inter- and intra-organizational influences. An empirical study with 233 high-ranking IT executives reveals that adoption results from social contagion, while organizational capabilities such as trust, firm innovativeness, tendency to outsource, and IT department size, influence adoption from an intra-organizational perspective. The findings show that mimetic pressures and trust play major roles in adoption processes, which differentiates grid computing from other inter-organizational systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
