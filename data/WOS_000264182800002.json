As bilevel decision making often involves many uncertain factors in real world problems, it is hard to formulate the objective functions and constraints of the leader and the follower in modelling a real bilevel decision problem. This study explores a new approach that uses rule sets to formulate a bilevel decision problem. It first develops related theories to prove the feasibility to model a bilevel decision problem by rule sets. It then proposes an algorithm to describe the modelling process. A case study is discussed to illustrate the functions and effectiveness of the proposed rule sets based bilevel decision modelling algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
