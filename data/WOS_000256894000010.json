We accommodate faces and fingerprints without a mandatory requirement of (tamper-resistant) smart-card-level devices on e-passports for easier deployment. It is even allowable to imprint (publicly readable) bar codes on the passports. Additionally, we present a solution based on the certification and key management method to control the validity of passports within the current Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology paradigm.", "paper_title": "Biometric authentication for border control applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000256894000010"}
