In this report we describe a new unique public Ames mutagenicity data set comprising about 6500 nonconfidential compounds (available as SMILES strings and SDF) together with their biological activity. Three commercial tools (DEREK, MultiCASE, and an off-the-shelf Bayesian machine learner in Pipeline Pilot) are compared with four noncommercial machine learning implementations (Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Gaussian Processes) on the new benchmark data set.", "paper_title": "Benchmark Data Set for in Silico Prediction of Ames Mutagenicity", "paper_id": "WOS:000270093800006"}
