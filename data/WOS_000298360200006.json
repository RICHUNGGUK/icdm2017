Street properties (e. g., street names) and angles between street segments are the two main elements used for generating street strokes according to the continuity principle of perceptual grouping into networks. However, it is difficult to automatically generate strokes with good continuity from street networks with multiple lanes such as dual carriageways or complex street junctions. This article proposes a method for generating street strokes that maintain good continuity across multiple lanes and complex street junctions. The proposed method first detects dual carriageways and complex junctions in street networks and then generates strokes according to the continuity principle of perceptual grouping. Finally, it groups the generated street strokes across the dual carriageways and complex street junctions to maintain good continuity. Moreover, the generated strokes are hierarchically ranked based on stroke length and centrality measurements. Experimental studies demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. The result shows that the generated street strokes maintain good continuity and reflect well the hierarchical structure of the street networks.", "paper_title": "Generating hierarchical strokes from urban street networks based on spatial pattern recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000298360200006"}
