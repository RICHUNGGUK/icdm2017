The waveguide cross-section is defined as a Fourier series whose unknown coefficients are optimized using genetic algorithm to reach a proper cross-section for waveguide. A verified finite difference method is used in analysis stage of optimization. The results show that optimum designed nonuniform cross-section waveguides have lower conductor attenuation constant in comparison with double ridged waveguides of the same bandwidth.
