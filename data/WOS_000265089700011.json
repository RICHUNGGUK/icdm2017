Relationship between the belief-structure-based and the belief-space-based fuzzy Dempster-Shafer models is then established. It is shown that the lower and upper fuzzy probabilities induced by the fuzzy belief space yield a dual pair of fuzzy belief and plausibility functions. For any fuzzy belief structure, there must exist a fuzzy belief space such that the fuzzy belief and plausibility functions defined by the given fuzzy belief structure are just the lower and upper fuzzy probabilities induced by the fuzzy belief space, respectively. Essential properties of the fuzzy belief and plausibility functions are also examined. The fuzzy belief and plausibility functions are, respectively, a fuzzy monotone Choquet capacity and a fuzzy alternating Choquet capacity of infinite order.", "paper_title": "On Generalized Fuzzy Belief Functions in Infinite Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700011"}
