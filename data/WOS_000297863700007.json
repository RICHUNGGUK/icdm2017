The CPG has been successfully applied to walking controllers and controllers for walking robots. However, the robustness of walking motion with the CPG-based controller is not sufficient, especially when subjected to external forces or environmental variations. To achieve a realistic and stable walking motion of the controller, we propose the use of an attracting controller in parallel with the CPG-based controller. The robustness of the proposed controller is confirmed through simulation results.", "paper_title": "Robust control of CPG-based 3D neuromusculoskeletal walking model", "paper_id": "WOS:000297863700007"}
