Unfortunately there is no agreement today on a common set of standards and, therefore, different conceptions lead to different middleware implementations. That effectively rendered interoperability between grid infrastructures to be a complex issue, from which originally sprang the idea of Grid. In this paper we present technologies to achieve interoperation (i.e. interoperability not based on standards) between sites and show its feasibility, aiming to provide a mid-term solution to the federation problem until the promise of interoperability through standards becomes a reality. Using interoperation techniques and bringing them together in a common federation component, the GridWay metascheduler, we are able to offer common access to well known grid infrastructures. This approach is demonstrated in the performance evaluation of the execution of one benchmark of the NAS Grid Benchmark suite. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
