The dissipativity theory is introduced into the design of fault detection and a unique scheme that simultaneously performs fault isolation and FTC. The proposed framework relies on a simple dissipativity-based switching among a family of pre-computed candidate controllers without any additional model or filter. The states are ensured to be bounded during the switching delay. A RLC circuit example illustrates the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Switching fault tolerant control design via global dissipativity", "paper_id": "WOS:000280248000008"}
