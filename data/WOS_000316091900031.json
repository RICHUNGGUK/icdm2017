In the recent years, several identity-based (ID-based) authenticated key agreement protocols have been proposed and most of them broken. In this paper, we formalize the security model of ID-based authenticated tripartite key agreement protocol and propose a provably secure ID-based authenticated key agreement protocol for three parties with formal security proof under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Experimental results by using the AVISPA tool show that the proposed protocol is secure against various malicious attacks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
