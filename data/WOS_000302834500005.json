As an example of a controlled system, a controller with a rotary inverted pendulum as a controlled object, is considered. The feedback loop in between is the power line. The control performance is evaluated in the power line cyclostationary noise environment and compared against the performance in a stationary noise environment. As a result, it is confirmed that the power line and its cyclostationary noise features present an advantage against transmission in a channel with stationary noise.", "paper_title": "Control Quality of a Feedback Control System under Cyclostationary Noise in Power Line Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000302834500005"}
