So update management in peer data management systems (PDMSs) is a hot research area. This paper researches on view maintenance in PDMSs. First, the definition of view is extended and the peer view, local view and global view are proposed according to the requirements of applications. There are two main factors to influence materialized views in PDMSs. One is that schema mappings between peers are changed, and the other is that peers update their data. Based on the requirements, this paper proposes an algorithm called 2DCMA, which includes two sub-algorithms: data and definition consistency maintenance algorithms, to effectively maintain views. For data consistency maintenance, Mork's rules are extended for governing the use of updategrams and boosters. The new rule system can be used to optimize the execution plan. And are extended for the data consistency maintenance algorithm is based on the new rule system. Furthermore, an ECA rule is adopted for definition consistency maintenance. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted in SPDMS. The simulation results show that the 2DCMA algorithm has better performance than that of Mork's when maintaining data consistency. And the 2DCMA algorithm has better performance than that of centralized view maintenance algorithm when maintaining definition consistency.", "paper_title": "2DCMA: An effective maintenance algorithm of materialized views in peer data management systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239255200007"}
