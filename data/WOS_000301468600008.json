Although there is a large literature on this, new publicly available software repositories allow us to empirically perform further research. In this paper we analyse the relationships between productivity, team size and other project variables using the International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) repository. To do so, we apply statistical approaches to a preprocessed subset of the ISBSG repository to facilitate the study. The results show some expected correlations between productivity, effort and time as well as corroborating some other beliefs concerning team size and productivity. In addition, this study concludes that in order to apply statistical or data mining techniques to these type of repositories extensive preprocessing of the data needs to be performed due to ambiguities, wrongly recorded values, missing values, unbalanced datasets, etc. Such preprocessing is a difficult and error prone activity that would need further guidance and information that is not always provided in the repository.
