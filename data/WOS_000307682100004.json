The idea is based on using a static tree structure, the Cluster-K+ tree, that maintains most of the structural information about peers and labels. A label denotes a set of replicated or co-related data in the network. The Cluster-K+ tree provides efficient retrieval, addition, deletion and consistent updates of labels. Our proposed structure guarantees a short response search time of O(H + K), where H denotes the height of the tree and K the degree of an internal tree node. We present theoretical analytic bounds for the worst-case performance. To verify the bounds, we also present experimental results obtained from a network simulation. The results demonstrate that the actual performance of our system is significantly better than the theoretical bounds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
