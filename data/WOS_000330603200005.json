Under impulsive function satisfied ordered conditions, and under compact semigroup, or noncompactness measure, or normal cone, we obtained the existence of omega-periodic mild solutions for impulsive evolution equation by using the monotone iterative technique. The results improve and extend the evolution equations without impulse and some relevant results in ordinary differential equations.", "paper_title": "Monotone Iterative Technique of Periodic Solutions for Impulsive Evolution Equations in Banach Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603200005"}
