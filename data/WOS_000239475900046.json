While satisliability in several expressive fragments of the fully enriched mu-calculus is known to be decidable and EXPTIME-complete, it has recently been proved that the full calculus is undecidable. In this paper, we study the fragments of the fully enriched p-calculus that are obtained by dropping at least one of the additional constructs. We show that, in all fragments obtained in this way, satisfiability is decidable and EXPTIME-complete. Thus, we identify a family of decidable logics that are maximal (and incomparable) in expressive power. Our results are obtained by introducing two new automata models, showing that their emptiness problems are EXPTIME-complete, and then reducing satisfiability in the relevant logics to this problem. The automata models we introduce are two-way graded alternating parity automata over infinite trees (2GAPT) and fully enriched automata (FEA) over infinite forests. The former are a common generalization of two incomparable automata models from the literature. The latter extend alternating automata in a similar way as the fully enriched mu-calculus extends the standard mu-calculus.", "paper_title": "The complexity of enriched mu-calculi", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900046"}
