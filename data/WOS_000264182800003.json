The proposed model enables qualitative and quantitative temporal constraints to be established, introduces the representation of causal constraints, and suggests mechanisms for representing inexact temporal knowledge. The temporal handling of information is achieved by structuring the information in different interpretation contexts, linked to each other through an inference mechanism which obtains interpretations that are consistent with the original temporal information. In carrying out inferences, we take into account the temporal relationships between events, the possible inexactitude associated with the events, and the atemporal or static information which affects the interpretation pattern being considered. The proposed schema is illustrated with an application developed using the CommonKADS methodology. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
