The proposed logic is based on a three phase operation where, in order to obtain a constant energy consumption over the operating cycle, an additional discharge phase is performed after pre-charge and evaluation. In this work, the proposed concept has been implemented as an enhancement of the SABL logic with a limited increase in circuit complexity. Implementation details and simulation results are reported which show a power consumption independent of the sequence of processed data and load capacitances. An improvement in the energy consumption balancing up to 100 times with respect to SABL has been obtained.", "paper_title": "Three-phase dual-rail pre-charge logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000242313400019"}
