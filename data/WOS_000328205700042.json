Our computations indicated that the ground electronic state of U-2 is the septet state and the equilibrium bond length is 2.194; the ground electronic state of U2O and U2O2 were found to be e X3 F and eX3 S g with stable C8 v and D8 h linear structures, respectively. The bridge-bonded structure with D2h symmetry and e X 3 B1g state is the most stable configuration for the U(2)O4 molecule. Mulliken population analyses show that U atoms always lose electrons to become the donor and O atoms always obtain electrons as the acceptor. Molecular orbital analyses demonstrated that the frontier orbitals of the title molecules were contributed mostly by 5f atomic orbitals of U atoms. Vibrational frequencies analyses indicate that the maximum absorption peaks stem from the stretching mode of U-O bonds in U2O, U2O2 and U2O4. In addition, thermodynamic data of U2O4 (n = 0 similar to 4) molecules at elevated temperatures of 293.0 K to 393.0 K was predicted.", "paper_title": "Structures, spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of U2On (n=0 similar to 2, 4) molecules: a density functional theory study", "paper_id": "WOS:000328205700042"}
