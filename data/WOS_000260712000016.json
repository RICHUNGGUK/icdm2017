The goal is to sort these n elements by pairwise comparisons, subject to the condition that the kth element must not be the loser (= smaller element) in more than a(k) of its comparisons against the other elements. We completely characterize the sequences a(1) .... a(n) for which this sorting problem can be solved. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
