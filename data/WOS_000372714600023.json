He showed that every operator with such an operational semantics can be translated into CSP and therefore has a semantics in every model of CSP. In this paper we demonstrate that a similar result holds for CSP extended by the priority operator described in Chapter 20 of [15], with the restriction on negative premises removed.", "paper_title": "The Expressiveness of CSP With Priority", "paper_id": "WOS:000372714600023"}
