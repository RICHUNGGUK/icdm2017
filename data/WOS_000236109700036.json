As part of OMICS data collection, we asked users to enter different ways of asking a robot to perform specific tasks. This paraphrasing data is processed using Natural Language techniques and lexical resources like WordNet to generate a Finite State Grammar Transducer (FSGT). This transducer captures the variations in user requests and captures their structure. We compare the task recognition performance of this FSGT model with an n-gram Statistical Language Model (SLM). The SLM model is trained with the same data that was used to generate the FSGT. The FSGT model and SLM are combined in a two-pass system to optimize full and partial recognition for both in-grammar and out-of-grammar user requests. Our work validates the use of a web based knowledge capture system to harvest phrases to build grammar models. Work was performed using Nuance Speech Recognition system.", "paper_title": "Finite state grammar transduction from distributed collected knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000236109700036"}
