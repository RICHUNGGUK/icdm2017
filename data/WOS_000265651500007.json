An efficient treatment of individuals and population for finite element models is presented which is different from traditional GAs application in structural design. GAs operators of crossover and mutation suitable for topology optimization problems are developed. The effects of various parameters used in the proposed GA on the optimization speed and performance are examined. Several 2D and 3D examples of compliance minimization problems are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed new approach and its capability of obtaining convergent solutions. Wherever possible, the numerical results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the solutions of other GA methods and the SIMP method.", "paper_title": "Combining genetic algorithms with BESO for topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000265651500007"}
