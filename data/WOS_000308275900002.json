The main results regard partial equivalency of Bayes solutions for regression problems and the transformed classification ones, and improved Vapnik-Chervonenkis bounds for the proposed method compared to Support Vector Machines. We conducted experiments comparing the proposed method with epsilon-insensitive Support Vector Regression (epsilon-SVR) on various synthetic and real world data sets. The results indicate that the new method can achieve comparable generalization performance as epsilon-SVR with significantly improved the number of support vectors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
