A comparative study has been conducted on simulated data sets and several real problem data sets. The algorithm has been compared with not only a recent approach called Incremental Mixture of Factor Analysers (IMoFA) but also the conventional two-stage implementation of maximum likelihood (ML) plus model selection, namely, using the EM algorithm for parameter learning on a series candidate models, and selecting one best candidate by AIC, CAIC, and BIC. Experiments have shown that IMoFA and ML-BIC outperform ML-AIC or ML-CAIC while the BYY harmony learning considerably outperforms IMoFA and ML-BIC. Furthermore, this BYY learning algorithm has been applied to the popular MNIST database for digits recognition with a promising performance.", "paper_title": "Local factor analysis with automatic model selection: A comparative study and digits recognition application", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200027"}
