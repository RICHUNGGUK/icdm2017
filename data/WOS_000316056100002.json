Using finite element modelling, effects of combinations of the intervention carried out at a proximal (P), an intermediate (I) and a distal (D) location were studied: (1) Case P, (2) Case P-I, (3) Case P-D and (4) Case P-I-D. Compared to Case P, the effects of multiple interventions on muscle geometry and sarcomere lengths were sizable for the distal population of muscle fibres: e.g. at high muscle length (1) summed gap lengths between the cut ends of aponeurosis increased by 16, 25 and 27% for Cases P-I, P-D and P-I-D, respectively, (2) characteristic substantial sarcomere shortening became more pronounced (mean shortening was 26, 29, 30 and 31% for Cases P, P-I, P-D and P-I-D, respectively) and (3) fibre stresses decreased (mean stress equalled 0.49, 0.39, 0.38 and 0.33 for Cases P, P-I, P-D and P-I-D, respectively). In contrast, no appreciable effects were shown for the proximal population. The overall change in sarcomere length heterogeneity was limited. Consequently, the effects of multiple aponeurotomy on muscle lengthforce characteristics were marginal: (1) a limited reduction in active muscle force (maximal muscle weakening effect' remained between 5 and 11%) and (2) an even less pronounced change in slack to optimum length range of force exertion (maximal muscle lengthening effect' distally was 0.2% for Case P-I-D) were shown. The intended effects of the intervention were dominated by the one intervention carried out closer to the tendon suggesting that aponeurotomies done additionally to that may counter-indicated.", "paper_title": "In muscle lengthening surgery multiple aponeurotomy does not improve intended acute effects and may counter-indicate: an assessment by finite element modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000316056100002"}
