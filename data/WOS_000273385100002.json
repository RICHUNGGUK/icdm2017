In the literature, there are a lot of studies related to using of information axiom for the solution of decision making problems. Moreover, applications of information axiom have been increasing day by day. However, calculation procedure of information axiom is not only incommodious but also difficult for decision makers. In this paper, a decision support system (DSS) based on fuzzy information axiom (FIA) is developed in order to make this decision procedure easy. The developed system consists of a knowledge base module including facts and rules, inference engine module including FIA and aggregation method, and a user interface module including entrance windows. The main aim of this study is to present a DSS tool to help the decision makers to solve their decision problems by modifying data-base of the program. In this paper, an application procedure will be presented based on the optimal selection of location for emergency service to illustrate the implementation procedure of the proposed model.
