The normal form of a Frobenius expansion is the polynomial with integer coefficients obtained by reducing a Frobenius expansion modulo the characteristic polynomial of Frobenius. We consider the distribution of the coefficients of reductions of Frobenius expansions and non-adjacent forms of Frobenius expansions (NAFs) to normal form. We give asymptotic bounds on the coefficients which improve on naive bounds, for both genus one and genus two. We also discuss the non-uniformity of the distribution of the coefficients (assuming a uniform distribution for Frobenius expansions).", "paper_title": "On the distribution of the coefficients of normal forms for Frobenius expansions", "paper_id": "WOS:000291746200005"}
