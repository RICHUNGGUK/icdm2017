The proposed hierarchical gradient diffusion aims to balance sensor node's transmission loading, enhance sensor node's lifetime, and reduce the data package transmission loss rate. According to the experimental results, the proposed algorithm not only reduces power consumption about 12% but also decreases data loss rate by 85.5% and increases active nodes by about 51.7%.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Gradient Diffusion Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000368218000005"}
