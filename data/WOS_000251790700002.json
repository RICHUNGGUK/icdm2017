The proposed communication framework incorporates the following two things: a new concept of wireless home network architecture and a new routing technique in an effort to improve wireless communication coverage and end-to-end seamless packet delivery respectively. First, the proposed wireless home network architecture based on the End-to-end Seamless multi-hop COnnectivity based on Dual-mode (ESCOD) integrates infrastructure and ad hoc modes in an IEEE 802.11-based wireless home network. Second, the Virtual Link Routing (VLR) technique, a kind of ad hoc routing protocols working on the layer 2.5, provides mobile nodes with end-to-end seamless connectivity and packet delivery. We compare the performance of VLR with two prominent on-demand routing protocols for Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Ad hoc On demand Distance Vector (AODV), in the ESCOD-based wireless home network. Experiments show that our communication framework incorporating the VLR technique in the ESCOD-based wireless home network architecture yields efficient performance in terms of the low failure rate of packet transmission, fast packet transmission time, network throughput, and a wider coverage area of wireless home networks.
