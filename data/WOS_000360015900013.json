The DoF outer bounds reveal a fundamental rank-matching phenomenon, reminiscent of impedance matching in circuit theory. It is well known that the maximum power transfer in a circuit is achieved not for the maximum or minimum load impedance but for the load impedance that matches the source impedance. Similarly, the maximum DoF in the rank-constrained 2 x 2 x 2 MIMO interference network is achieved not for the maximum or minimum ranks of the destination hop, but when the ranks of the destination hop match the ranks of the source hop. In fact, for mismatched settings of interest, the outer bounds identify a DoF loss penalty that is precisely equal to the rank-mismatch between the two hops. For symmetric settings, we also provide achievability results to show that along with the min-cut max-flow bounds, the rank-mismatch bounds are the best possible, i.e., they hold for all channels that satisfy the rank-constraints and are tight for almost all channels that satisfy the rank-constraints. Limited extensions-from sum-DoF to DoF region, from 2 unicasts to X message sets, from 2 hops to more than 2 hops and from 2 nodes per layer to more than 2 nodes per layer-are considered to illustrate how the insights generalize beyond the elemental 2 x 2 x 2 channel model.", "paper_title": "Rank Matching for Multihop Multiflow", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900013"}
