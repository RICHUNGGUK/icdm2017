With the well-established results of Lyapunov stability theory and nonnegative matrix, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of desired H-infinity state-feedback controllers that guaranteeing the resultant closed-loop system not only to be asymptotically stable and positive, but also has a desired H-infinity performance. Moreover, even for an unstable and non-positive system, the results obtained can be applied to design a desired H-infinity controller such that the closed-loop system not only is stable and positive but also has an H-infinity performance. Since the conditions obtained are expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily verified by using standard numerical software. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the proposed design scheme.", "paper_title": "H-infinity CONTROL OF LINEAR POSITIVE SYSTEMS: CONTINUOUS- AND DISCRETE-TIME CASES", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400026"}
