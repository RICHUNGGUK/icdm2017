However, implementing wireless sensor networks present new challenges compared with theoretical networks. In addition, implementing a sensor network might provide results different from that derived theoretically. Some routing protocols when implemented might fail to perform. In this paper, we implement three routing protocols, namely: Dynamic MANET on-demand, Collection Tree and Dissemination protocols. To compare the performance of these protocols, they are implemented using a Telosb sensor network. Several performance metrics are carried out to demonstrate the pros and cons of these protocols. A telemedicine application is tested in top of the implemented Telosb sensor network at King Fand University of Petroleum and Minerals Clinic in Saudi Arabia, utilizing Alive ECG sensors.", "paper_title": "A web-based application of TELOSB sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000291524100004"}
