One aspect of context that is pertained to the users' situation is body posture of a sitting person. The aim of this paper is the design and development of a novel Aware Chair system that recognizes sitting body postures. The Aware Chair is based on digital sensors mounted on the sitting and back area of the chair. The chair is tested using 50 people with different gender, body mass, and height. The design details of the system as well as test results are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a system for body posture recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500012"}
