The structure of the lattice of clones on sets of finitely many (but more than 2) elements is more complex; in fact, the lattice is of cardinality 2(aleph 0). One approach is to study the monoidal intervals: the set of clones whose unary operations form a given monoid. In this article, we study the monoidal interval for the monoid generated by two constants on sets of k elements for k finite. This interval contains the clones of term operations of the bounded lattices of k elements.", "paper_title": "The Monoidal Interval for the Monoid Generated by Two Constants", "paper_id": "WOS:000271530500013"}
