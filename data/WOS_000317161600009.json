Beside heart transplants, which are a limited option due to the limited number of available human donor hearts, Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs) are the only therapy available for some patients with terminal heart diseases. For various reasons a total implantable artificial heart is desirable, but also sets restrictions in terms of weight and dimensions due to the limited space in the human thorax. Therefore a precise requirement profile is needed for the drive design to provide sufficient force for the blood pump and to avoid oversizing of the drive and to prevent blood damage by overheating.
