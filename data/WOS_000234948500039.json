The system is composed of total n components and it functions until (n - k + 1) components are failed. The works that should be performed by the system arrive at the system according to a homogeneous Poisson process and it is assumed that the system can perform sufficiently large number of works simultaneously. The system is subject to a workload which can be expressed in terms of the arrival rate of the work and the workload is equally shared by surviving components in the system. We assume that an increased workload induces a higher failure rate of each remaining component. The time consumed for the completion of each work is assumed to be a constant or a random quantity following an Exponential distribution. Under this model, as a measure for system performance, we derive the long-run average number of works performed per unit time and consider optimal workload which maximizes the system performance.", "paper_title": "Optimal workload for a multi-tasking k-out-of-n : G load sharing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500039"}
