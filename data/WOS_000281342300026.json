It is based on making the Minimum Variance Distortion less Response (MVDR) power spectrum estimation method robust against noise. This robustness is obtained by modifying the distortionless constraint of the MVDR spectral estimation method via weighting the sub-band power spectrum values based on the sub-band signal to noise ratios. The optimum weighting is obtained by employing the experimental findings of psychoacoustics. According to our experiments, this technique is successful in modifying the power spectrum of speech signals and making it robust against noise. The above method, when evaluated on Aurora 2 task for recognition purposes, outperformed both the MFCC features as the baseline and the MVDR-based features in different noisy conditions.", "paper_title": "A New Subband-Weighted MVDR-Based Front-End for Robust Speech Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342300026"}
