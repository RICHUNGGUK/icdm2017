However, it is difficult to control personal privacy information because of the opening, virtualization, multi-tenancy and service outsourcing characters. Therefore how to protect user privacy information has become a research focus in cloud computing. Considering the service outsourcing character, we propose a privacy information description method and negotiation mechanism. Firstly, we describe privacy property with Privacy Negotiation Language (PNL) based on description logic. Secondly, we get privacy attribute sequence through pre-negotiation between user and service composer. Thirdly, though exchanging privacy disclosure assertion, we obtain privacy policy that satisfying both parties. In the end, we put forward privacy policy negotiation algorithm. Through case study we proved the feasibility and correctness of this method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
