The proposed framework consists of three modules: the feature vector space construction using discriminative patterns extracted from TCGs by a graph-mining algorithm; a feature vector supervised learning procedure in the constructed vector space; and an application identification program using a similarity measure in the feature vector space. Accuracy of the proposed framework for application identification is evaluated, making use of ground truth packet traces from seven peer-to-peer (P2P) application programs. It is demonstrated that this framework achieves an overall 90.0% accuracy in application identification. Contributions are twofold: (1) using a graph-mining algorithm, the proposed framework enables automatic extraction of discriminative patterns serving as identification features; 2) high accuracy in application identification is achieved, notably for P2P applications that are more difficult to identify because of their using random ports and potential communication encryption.
