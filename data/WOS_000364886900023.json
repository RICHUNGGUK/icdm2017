For the first time, this property allows us to simultaneously construct a Calderon multiplicative preconditioner for the discretized operator and for a 3-D hybrid finite/boundary element method formulation, applicable to electromagnetic scattering problems. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel preconditioning scheme, even for heterogeneous domains with non-smooth boundaries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
