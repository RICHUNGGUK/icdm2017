The base classifiers are: fuzzy clustering, parametric and non-parametric Bayesian approaches, self-organizing feature maps and two versions of learning vector quantization. During the learning phase different partitions are established until a valid partition is found. The partitioning and validation are two automatic processes based on validation measurements. These measures allow computing the competences of each base classifier which are mapped as the weights to be used during the decision process through the MCDM. The design of the unsupervised classifier from supervised base classifiers and the automatic computation of the competences make the main contributions of this paper. Although the method is designed for six classifiers it can be extended for a greater number of classifiers. The method is applied for classifying textures in natural images. The analysis of the results shows that the performance of the proposed method is superior to other hybrid methods and the single usage of existing classification methods. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
