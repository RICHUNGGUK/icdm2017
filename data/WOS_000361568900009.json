This method relies on a feature fitting algorithm incorporated into the boundary evolvement process in order to regulate the noisy velocity fields and thus introduce new explicit feature primitives; once inserted, the feature-based shape optimization algorithm is implemented to determine the optimum part shape and topology. The research novelty lies in that, the best-fit feature primitives are inserted during the topology optimization process while other researchers so far have reported only manipulating some existing features with the conventional level-set methods. Therefore, feature-based design can be realized without special requirement of initial input or any post-processing. From the perspective of potential applications, the engineering information embedded in those feature primitives can be extracted and integrated into the optimization formulation. Such potential integration can make the topology optimization even more useful and practical. This effort is an extension of level-set topology optimization into a domain of structural optimization for manufacturing (OFM).", "paper_title": "3D level-set topology optimization: a machining feature-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000361568900009"}
