Anion-exchange and rehydration procedures were used for the preparation of TPPS-containing LDH with an Mg/Al molar ratio of 2. Molecular modeling was carried out in the Cerius(2) and Materials Studio modeling environment. Three types of models were created in order to simulate the experimental XRD patterns of LDH intercalates with a TPPS loading of 70-80% with respect to the theoretical anion exchange capacity (AEC). The models represent single-phase systems with a 100% TPPS loading in the interlayer space (Type 1) and models represent the coexistence of two phases corresponding to the total exchange from 75 to 92% (Type 2). To cover other possible arrangements, models with the coexistence of both TPPS and NO (3) (-) anions in the same interlayer space were calculated (Type 3). The models are described and compared with experimental data. In all cases, guest TPPS anions are tilted with respect to the hydroxide layers, and are horizontally shifted to each other by up to one-half of the TPPS diameter. According to the energy characteristics and simulated XRD, the most probable arrangement is of Type 2, where some layers are saturated with TPPS anions and others are filled with original NO (3) (-) anions.", "paper_title": "Mg-Al layered double hydroxide intercalated with porphyrin anions: molecular simulations and experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000273668800007"}
