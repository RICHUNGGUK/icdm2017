The use of a reduced model is particularly appealing in the context of numerical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations that are typically performed, e.g., within environmental risk assessment protocols. In this context, model order reduction techniques enable one to construct a surrogate model to reduce the computational burden associated with the solution of the partial differential equation governing the evolution of the system. These techniques approximate the model solution with a linear combination of spatially distributed basis functions calculated from a small set of full model simulations. The number and the spatial behavior of these basis functions determine the computational efficiency of the reduced model and the accuracy of the approximated solution. The greedy algorithm provides a deterministic procedure to select the basis functions and build the reduced-order model. Starting from a single basis function, the algorithm enriches the set of basis functions until the largest error between the full and the reduced model solutions is lower than a predefined tolerance. The comparison between the standard MC and the reduced-order approach is performed through a two-dimensional steady-state groundwater flow scenario in the presence of a uniform (in the mean) hydraulic head gradient. The natural logarithm of the aquifer transmissivity is modeled as a second-order stationary Gaussian random field. The accuracy of the reduced basis model is assessed as a function of the correlation scale and variance of the log-transmissivity. We explore the performance of the reduced model in terms of the number of iterations of the greedy algorithm and selected metrics quantifying the discrepancy between the sample distributions of hydraulic heads computed with the full and the reduced model. Our results show that the reduced model is accurate and is highly efficient in the presence of a small variance and/or a large correlation length of the log-transmissivity field. The flow scenarios associated with large variances and small correlation lengths require an increased number of basis functions to accurately describe the collection of the MC solutions, thus reducing significantly the computational advantages associated with the reduced model.", "paper_title": "A reduced-order model for Monte Carlo simulations of stochastic groundwater flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000336396700004"}
