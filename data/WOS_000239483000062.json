The global classifier is built using a boosting cascade to eliminate most non-objects in the image and give a probabilistic confidence for the final fusion. In constructing the part-based classifier, we boost several neural networks to select the most effective object parts and combine the weak classifiers effectively. The fusion of these two classifiers generates a more powerful detector either on efficiency or accuracy. Our approach is evaluated on a database of real-world images containing rear-view cars. The fused classifier gives distinctively superior performance than traditional cascade classifiers.", "paper_title": "Object detection via fusion of global classifier and part-based classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000062"}
