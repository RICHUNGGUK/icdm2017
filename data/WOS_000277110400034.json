Views and intentions were investigated via a questionnaire administered to 240 in-service and 428 pre-service early childhood teachers Confirmatory Factor Analysis showed that the one-factor structure of the questionnaire holds in both populations. Measurement partial invariance between the two populations was confirmed. Comparing the two populations with regard to the degree of adopting positive views-intentions and the level of computer self-efficacy, teachers expressed more positive views-intentions and students reported higher computer self-efficacy Implications for teacher training are discussed.
