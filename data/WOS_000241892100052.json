Packet scheduling discipline is a crucial technique to enable this. This paper proposes a new weighted fair queuing discipline - Probability based Weighted Fair Queueing, P-WFQ - for high-speed, integrated-service, packet-switched networks. P-WFQ reduces the complexity of implementation by avoiding the main problem of traditional weighted fair queueing algorithm - the calculation of the weight parameter for each packet. It uses a random number to find the next packet to be serviced. In addition, it uses a novel grouping technology, which congregates large number of different flows into a smaller number of groups and reduces the complexity of P-WFQ greatly. This makes it suit for high-speed networks. The simulations prove the validity and practicability of P-WFQ.", "paper_title": "Probability based weighted fair queueing algorithm with adaptive buffer management for high-speed network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100052"}
