An Iterative Learning Control (ILC) based scheme is established to deal with radial error propagation and improve the quality of written tracks. In the proposed scheme, a feedback controller for track following is first designed to achieve good disturbance attenuation. Then, an ILC structure is applied to generate an external signal, which is injected into the feedback loop in order to compensate for the written-in errors in the previous track while the next track is written. As a result, the error propagation can be contained. The learning controller is synthesized by solving Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) equations to ensure the stability and monotonic convergence of the control algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on the error containment which results in good quality written tracks. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
