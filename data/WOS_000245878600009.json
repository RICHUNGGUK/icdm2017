The capacitated vehicle routing problem is a classical problem in operations research in which a set of minimum total cost routes must be determined for a fleet of identical capacitated vehicles in order to service a number of demand or supply points. The applied metaheuristic combines the strengths of the well-known guided local search and evolution strategies metaheuristics into an iterative two-stage procedure. The computational experiments were carried out on a set of 76 benchmark problems. The results demonstrate that the suggested method is highly competitive, providing the best-known solutions to 70 test instances. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
