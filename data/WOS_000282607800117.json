Based on the two theories of intuitionistic fuzzy set and cross entropy, with the adoption of cross entropy of the degree of membership from the degree of non-membership handling the effect of hesitancy degree, two improved methods handling multicriteria fuzzy decision-making problem are provided. They are called score function method and weighted score function method. Finally, examples are given showing that the methods presented in this paper are more efficient and advantageous.
