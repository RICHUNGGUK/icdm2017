The antenna mainly consists of a radiation patch and a modified ground plane. To realize dual band-notched characteristics, a U-shaped stub embedded in the rectangular slot of the radiation patch and a novel coupled open-/shorted-circuit stub resonator are used on the backside of the substrate. The bandwidth of the dual notched bands can be controllable by adjusting some key parameters. The simulated and measured results indicate that the proposed antenna offers a very wide bandwidth from 2.6 to 18 GHz with Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) <2, except the dual notched bands of 3.3-3.7 GHz (World Interoperability for Microwave Access [WiMAX]) and 5.15-5.825 GHz (Wireless Local Area Network [WLAN]). Furthermore, good group delay and stable gains can be achieved over the operating frequencies.
