To obtain such information, players must be tracked over time and their movements processed so that individual actions and team plays are simultaneously analyzed. In order to perform this analysis in an automated, formal and accurate way, the authors developed a cost conscientious processing system fed by two overhead cameras (roughly one video stream for each half-field). Players are detected by vest colors, and Fuzzy Logic is used to allow for a given color to be shared by different teams. Color models for the background and the teams are dynamic over time to make up for changes in natural lighting conditions and consequent color changes. Player tracking is further enhanced using Kalman Filtering. Some examples of the analysis, made possible by the proposed system, are shown. Results are based on videos collected during the Portuguese Handball SuperCup competition for the year 2011.", "paper_title": "Vision system for tracking handball players using fuzzy color processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000320512000014"}
