Sequential cluster extraction means that the algorithm extracts 'one cluster at a time.' A characteristic parameter, called a noise parameter, is used in noise clustering based sequential clustering. We propose a novel sequential clustering method called new sequential clustering, extracts an arbitrary number of objects as one cluster by considering the noise parameter as a variable to be optimized. Experimental results with four data sets confirm the effectiveness of our proposal. These results also show that classification results strongly depend on parameter. and that our proposal is applicable to the first stage in a two-stage clustering algorithm.", "paper_title": "On a Family of New Sequential Hard Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000370191300005"}
