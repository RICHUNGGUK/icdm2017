The method is based on a representation of the document in chain points extracted from the skeleton. We merge successively these chain points into a dendrogram framework and according to a measure of density. From the dendrogram, we extract potential symbols which can be recognized after.", "paper_title": "A method for symbol spotting in graphical documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773400046"}
