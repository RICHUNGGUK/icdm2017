Adaptive approximation methods will be designed to address the unknown nonlinearities. Via the backstepping algorithm, we construct adaptive state-feedback controller under certain conditions, which is robust against parametric uncertainties and enable the class of switched systems stabilized under arbitrary switchings in probability. The simulation results demonstrate that the asymptotic stability of system performance can be adjusted by choosing suitable design parameters.
