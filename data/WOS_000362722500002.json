We have also obtained a closed form expression for the primary service outage probability in a Rayleigh fading channel. Furthermore, an approximation was formulated for a general fading channel. The results obtained were used to drive an expression for the secondary service successful transmission density. Finally, we formulated an optimization problem to achieve highest density of secondary service successful transmissions while keeping the primary service outage probability in check by adjusting sensing error and secondary service node density to their optimal values.
