The paper exploits an approach that treats standard processor instructions (arithmetic and bitwise logical ones) as continuous functions on the space of 2-adic integers. Within this approach, a PRNG is considered as a dynamical system and is studied by means of the non-Archimedean ergodic theory.", "paper_title": "Non-Archimedean Ergodic Theory and Pseudorandom Generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000277226000002"}
