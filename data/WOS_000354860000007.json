ROF techniques are expected to form the backbone of the future fifth generation of wireless networks. The achievable link performance and the associated deployment cost constitute the most salient metrics of an ROF architecture. In this paper, we commence by providing a rudimentary overview of the ROF architecture, and then we elaborate on ROF techniques designed for improving the attainable system performance. We conclude by describing the ROF techniques conceived for reducing the ROF system installation costs.", "paper_title": "Performance Improvement and Cost Reduction Techniques for Radio Over Fiber Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000354860000007"}
