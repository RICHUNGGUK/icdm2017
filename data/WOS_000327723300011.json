The performance of the proposed BSD is examined by numerical analysis and demonstrated by experimental verification on our XG-PON test platforms. The results show that the BSD takes less than 5 minutes to update 45 user-terminal software, while the conventional unicast software download scheme normally takes more than one and half hours.", "paper_title": "Fast Management of ONUs Based on Broadcast Control Channel for a 10-Gigabit-Capable Passive Optical Network (XG-PON) System", "paper_id": "WOS:000327723300011"}
