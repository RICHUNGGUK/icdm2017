By on-line approximating the unknown nonlinear functions and unmodeled dynamics by radial basis function (RBF) networks, the proposed approach does not require the unknown parameters to satisfy the linear dependence condition. It is proved that with the proposed control law, the closed-loop system is stable and the tracking error converges to zero in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and unknown nonlinearity. A simulation example is presented to demonstrate the method. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
