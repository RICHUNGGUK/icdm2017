The orthogonal-least-squares regression based on the leave-one-out test criteria is formulated within this unified data-modelling framework to construct sparse kernel models that generalise well. Examples from regression, classification and density estimation applications are used to illustrate the effectiveness of this generic data-modelling approach for constructing parsimonious kernel models with excellent generalisation capability.
