Biot's theory is employed to describe soil behavior. Using a Fourier-Bessel series expansion with the aid of a translational addition theorem, closed-form expressions for the scattering coefficients are developed by imposing continuity conditions at the pile-soil interfaces. The influence of certain parameters, such as pile rigidity and soil permeability on the screening performance of the pile barrier is investigated. Particular attention is focused on the influence of the soil permeability on the screening effectiveness of a row of piles in the frequency domain. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
