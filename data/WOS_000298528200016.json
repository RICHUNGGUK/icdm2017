In this paper, an ensemble algorithm based on Diversity Ensemble Creation by Oppositional Relabeling of Artificial Training Examples (DECORATEs) and Rotation Forest is proposed to solve the classification problem of remote sensing image. In this ensemble algorithm, the RBF neural networks are employed as base classifiers. Furthermore, interpolation technology for identical distribution is used to remold the input datasets. These remolded datasets will construct new classifiers besides the initial classifiers constructed by the Rotation Forest algorithm. The change of classification error is used to decide whether to add another new classifier. Therefore, the diversity among these classifiers will be enhanced and the accuracy of classification will be improved. Adaptability of the proposed algorithm is verified in experiments implemented on standard datasets and actual remote sensing dataset. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
