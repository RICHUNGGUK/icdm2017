If these tools were installed in separate computers, due to the license and system requirements, the design flow will be frequently interrupted, to handle the dreary data movement work, and the design efficiency will thus be reduced. To alleviate the above problem, a seamless and efficient design flow would be a must. The aim of this paper is to propose a service-oriented integrated EDA environment that can improve the smoothness of the design flow and consequently increase the overall design productivity. In our approach, a multi-agent framework based on JADE platform is used to manage distributed EDA tools, which are encapsulated as agent services. Mobile agents are allowed to autonomously and concurrently migrate among computers to access services for IC designers. To facilitate that, a scripting language is designed for mobile agents to allocate tasks, cooperate with each other, and select appropriate services. To demonstrate the feasibility of our method, an Integrated Circuit Design Cycle Assistant System (ICDCAS) for simplifying the manual operations in IC design cycles is developed by combining two EDA tools: ModelSim and Xilinx ISE. The implemented system proves to have the features of time saving and being free of mistakes incurred by manually operating and configuring the sophisticated EDA tools.", "paper_title": "Constructing Service-Oriented Integrated EDA Environment with Agent Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000298061100011"}
