If the membership functions are allowed to be unknown or partially unknown, then a fuzzy system may describe a wide class of nonlinear systems. However, in this case, the filter design of fuzzy systems, which is based on parallel distributed compensator strategy, is infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, a switching mechanism, which depends on the lower and upper bounds of the unknown membership functions, is introduced to construct the H-infinity filter with varying gains. Some examples given in the simulation section show that the proposed method can achieve a better disturbance attenuation performance than a simple fixed-gain filter design approach.", "paper_title": "Switching-Type H-infinity Filter Design for T-S Fuzzy Systems With Unknown or Partially Unknown Membership Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001400015"}
