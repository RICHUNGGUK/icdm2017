Weighted association rules and text mining techniques are used to derive the significance degree of each newly arrived news headline on the fluctuation of Taiwan Stock Exchange Financial Price Index on the next trading day. The experimental results reveal that the proposed work indeed achieves significant performance and demonstrate its feasibility in the applications of real-time information dissemination, such as financial news headlines via Internet.
