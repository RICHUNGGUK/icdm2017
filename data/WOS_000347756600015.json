Unlike traditional networks, such as the TCP/IP-based Internet, DTNs are often subject to high latency caused by very long propagation delays (e.g., interplanetary communication) and/or intermittent connectivity. Another feature that sets DTNs apart from conventional networks is that there is no guarantee of end-to-end connectivity between source and destination. Such distinct features pose a number of technical challenges in designing core network functions such as routing and congestion control. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art in DTN congestion control. We propose a taxonomy to map the DTN congestion control design space and use it to classify existing DTN congestion control mechanisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
