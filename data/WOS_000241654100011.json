Research has shown that ensemble is very effective for classification tasks. Diversity and accuracy are two basic requirements for the ensemble creation. In this paper, we propose an ensemble creation method based on GA wrapper feature selection. Preliminary experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed method is promising, especially when the number of training data is limited. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
