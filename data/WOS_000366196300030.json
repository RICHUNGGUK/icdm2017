In several applications, it appears that the variations of a group of attributes are often followed by some structural changes in the graph that one may assume they generate. We formalize the triggering pattern discovery problem as a method jointly rooted in sequence mining and graph analysis. We apply our approach on three real-world dynamic graphs of different natures-a co-authoring network, an airline network, and a social bookmarking system-assessing the relevancy of the triggering pattern mining approach.", "paper_title": "What effects topological changes in dynamic graphs?
