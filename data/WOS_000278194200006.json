We considered the question of whether the database might reveal a deeper level of knowledge than was apparent from direct inspection. Our results reveal that four constructs underlie this process. Three are confirmed through covariance-based structural equation modeling and a fourth is implied through existing data. Our results suggest refinement in service level agreements to create a different type of governance coordination to assist in aligning the outsourcing provider's execution more closely with the client's needs.
