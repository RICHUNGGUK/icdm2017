However, these estimators can be very sensitive to outliers in the data. In order to overcome this disadvantage, the usage of the maximum Trimmed Likelihood Estimator (TLE) and the maximum Extended Trimmed Quasi-Likelihood (ETQL) estimator is recommended to estimate the unknown parameters in a robust way. The superiority of these approaches in comparison with the MLE and EQL estimator is illustrated by an example and a simulation study. As a prominent measure of robustness, the finite sample Breakdown Point (BDP) of these estimators is characterized in this setting. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
