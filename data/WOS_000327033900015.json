Let V-n = {1, 2, . . ., n}. For a positive integer k, (V-k())n denotes the set of all k-subsets of V n. For a nonempty subset K of Vn-1, we let K-n((K)) denote the hypergraph (V-n, U-kCK V-k(n))). In this paper, we find a necessary and sufficient condition on n, q and k for the existence of a cyclic q-partition of K-n((Vk)). In particular, we prove that if p is prime then there is a cyclic p ff-partition of K-n((Vk)) if and only if p(alpha+beta) divides n, where beta = {log(p) k}. As an application of this result, we obtain two sufficient conditions on n(1), n(2), . . ., n(t), k, alpha and a prime p for the existence of a cyclic p(alpha)-partition of the complete t-partite k-uniform hypergraph K-n1, n2, . . ., nt((k)).", "paper_title": "Cyclic partitions of complete nonuniform hypergraphs and complete multipartite hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000327033900015"}
