We describe first the elaboration of dedicated shape indexes and second the construction of the associated classification submodel. Then we present a new method of texture characterization, based on the construction and the analysis of statistical matrices encoding the texture. The various characterization techniques developed in this paper are systematically compared to previous approaches. In particular, we paid special attention to the results obtained by a versatile classification method using a large range of descriptors dedicated to the characterization of shapes and textures. Finally, the last classifier built with our methods achieved 88% of classification out of the 94% possible.", "paper_title": "SHAPE AND TEXTURE INDEXES APPLICATION TO CELL NUCLEI CLASSIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000317135900010"}
