This biological behavior of MMK16 triggered our interest to study its binding affinity using NMR spectroscopy in LOX and its docking and molecular dynamics (MD) properties in LOX and COX enzymes. The present NMR and docking binding studies not only rationalize the obtained biological results since in all three receptors MMK16 shows high affinity and scoring but also make it a potential dual LOX-5/COX-2 inhibitor. Thus, this class of molecules must be further investigated for discovering compounds possessing better biological activity and more lasting biological effect.", "paper_title": "Docking and Molecular Dynamics Calculations of Pyrrolidinone Analog MMK16 Bound to COX and LOX Enzymes", "paper_id": "WOS:000291602600008"}
