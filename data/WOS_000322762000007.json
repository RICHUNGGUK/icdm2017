The geometry of the vertebrae was obtained from computed tomography images. The isolated vertebra model included an L1 vertebra loaded through polymethylmethacrylate plates located at the top and bottom of the vertebra, and the segment model included T12 to L2 vertebrae and seven ligaments, fibrous intervertebral discs and facet joints. Each model was examined with both homogeneous and spatially varying bone tissue properties. Stresses and strains were compared for uniform compression and flexion. Including material heterogeneity remarkably reduced the stiffness of the isolated L1 vertebra and increased the magnitudes of the minimum principal strains and stresses in the mid-transverse section. The stress and strain distributions further changed when physiological loading was applied to the L1 vertebra. In the segment models, including heterogeneous material properties increased the magnitude of the minimum principal strain by 158% in the centre of the mid-transverse section. Overall, the inclusion of heterogeneity and physiological loading increased the magnitude of the strains up to 346% in flexion and 273% in compression.", "paper_title": "Simulation of the behaviour of the L1 vertebra for different material properties and loading conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000322762000007"}
