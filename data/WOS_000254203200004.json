The scheme has been developed under the framework of the MUMIN network and tested on the analysis of multimodal behaviour in short video clips in Swedish, Finnish and Danish. The preliminary results obtained in these studies show that the reliability of the categories defined in the scheme is acceptable, and that the scheme as a whole constitutes a versatile analysis tool for the study of multimodal communication behaviour.", "paper_title": "The MUMIN coding scheme for the annotation of feedback, turn management and sequencing phenomena", "paper_id": "WOS:000254203200004"}
