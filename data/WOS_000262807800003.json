The piezoelectric actuator is widely chosen to design precise positioning system for achieving the sub-micro or nano-position. However, their motion range is only 100 pm. Here, a long-range nanometer positioning servo system with AC servo motor and ball screw mechanism is built for the precision manufacturing purpose. It needs a special design control algorithm to obtain quick transient response and precise steady state accuracy. A new model-free fuzzy controller is designed to control this low-cost motion stage for achieving nanometer step response positioning. It has a novel gain auto-tuning strategy in response to the transient or steady state responses requirement. The experimental results show that this approach can reach more than 30 cm stroke and the step response error is less than 60 nm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
