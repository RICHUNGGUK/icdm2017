By analyzing three industrial case studies of organizations with cloned product lines, we conclude that an efficient management of clones relies on both refactoring cloned variants into a single-copy product line representation and improving development experience when maintaining existing clones. We propose a framework that consists of seven conceptual operators for cloned product line management and show that these operators are adequate to realize development activities we observed in the analyzed case studies. We discuss options for implementing the operators and benefits of the operator-based view.", "paper_title": "Cloned product variants: from ad-hoc to managed software product lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000360859500005"}
