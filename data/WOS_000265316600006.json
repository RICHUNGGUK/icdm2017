Evidence of its significance, is its recent use in the IEEE 802.15.4a standard. UWB technology with joint consideration of directional antennas can benefit when compared to classical omni-directional antennas from the energy conservation viewpoint, which is of fundamental concern when it comes to wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, exploiting directionality, requires new approach in the design of a medium access control (MAC) protocol to be applied. In this work, idle nodes continuously rotate their receiving beams over 360, until a predefined preamble trailer is detected. The resulting scheme is a directional ultra-wideband MAC protocol, named DU-MAC, which deals effectively with the problem of deafness and the problem of determination of neighbors' location. Simulation-based studies will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in many critical parameters, such as throughput and network lifetime. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
