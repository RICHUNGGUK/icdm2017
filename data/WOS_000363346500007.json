Earned value management/earned schedule (EVM/ES) is a project control methodology that is typically applied for top-down project schedule control. However, traditional models do not correctly account for the multivariate nature of the EVM/ES measurement system. We therefore propose a multivariate model for EVM/ES, which implements a principal component analysis (PCA) on a simulated schedule control reference. During project progress, the real EVM/ES observations can then be projected onto these principal components. This allows for two new multivariate schedule control metrics (T-2 and SPE) to be calculated, which can be dynamically monitored on project control charts. Using a computational experiment, we show that these multivariate schedule control metrics lead to performance improvements and practical advantages in comparison with traditional univariate EVM/ES models.
