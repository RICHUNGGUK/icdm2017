Hence, their prediction is a crucial problem in structural bioinformatics. Here, we present a new web server, called SKINK, for string kernel based kink prediction. Extending our previous study, we also annotate the most probable kink position in a given alpha-helix sequence.", "paper_title": "SKINK: a web server for string kernel based kink prediction in alpha-helices", "paper_id": "WOS:000338109200058"}
