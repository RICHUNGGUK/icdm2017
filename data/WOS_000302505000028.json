First, we prove some fundamental properties of lambda j such as confluence and preservation of beta-strong normalisation. Second, we add a strong bisimulation to lambda j by means of an equational theory which captures in particular Regnier's sigma-equivalence. We then complete this bisimulation with two more equations for (de) composition of substitutions and we prove that the resulting calculus still preserves beta-strong normalization. Finally, we discuss some consequences of our results.", "paper_title": "PRESERVATION OF STRONG NORMALISATION MODULO PERMUTATIONS FOR THE STRUCTURAL lambda-CALCULUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302505000028"}
