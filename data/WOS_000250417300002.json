A path inclusion constraint p <= q is satisfied by a semistructured data if any node reached by the regular query p is also reached by the regular query q. In this paper, two problems are mainly studied: the implication problem and the problem of the existence of a finite exact model. -We give a new decision algorithm for the implication problem of a constraint p <= q by a set of bounded path constraints p(i) <= u(i) where p, q, and the p(i)'s are regular path expressions and the u(i)'s are words, improving in this particular case, the more general algorithms of S. Abiteboul and V Vianu, and N. Alechina et al. In the case of a set of word equalities u(i) equivalent to v(i), we provide a more efficient decision algorithm for the implication of a word equality u equivalent to v, improving the more general algorithm of R Buneman et al. We prove that, in this case, implication for nondeterministic models is equivalent to implication for (complete) deterministic ones. - We introduce the notion of exact model: an exact model of a set of path constraints C satisfies the constraint p <= q if and only if this constraint is implied by C. We prove that any set of constraints has an exact model and we give a decidable characterization of data which are exact models of bounded path inclusion constraints sets. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
