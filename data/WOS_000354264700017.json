Because most of the existing SPH fluid control methods employ the strategy of control force to control fluid particles, the artificial viscosity introduced by control force would lead to the loss of fine-scale details. Although the introduction of the low-pass filter can add details, it may easily destroy the target shape. To remedy the previous problems, we sample the control particles with curvature information to represent the shape complexity. Because of the shape's complexity, we suppress the generation of turbulence in the high-curvature areas and promote turbulence in the low-curvature regions. Our self-adaptive way to randomly generate turbulence can effectively prevent the lack of fluid dynamics caused by the artificial viscosity. Our new method can improve the visual quality of the fluid animation, and the shape control result is consistent to the target shape.
