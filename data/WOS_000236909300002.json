We analyze subtleties resulting from the involvement of random oracles in the interactive setting and derive our methodology. Then we investigate the Feige-Shamir 4-round ZK argument for NP in this model: First we show that a 2-round protocol is possible for a very interesting set of languages; we then show that while the original protocol is not concurrently secure in the public-key model, a modified protocol in our model is, in fact, concurrently secure in the bare public-key model. We point at applications and implications of this fact. Of possible independent interest is a concurrent attack against the Feige-Shamir ZK in the public-key model (for which it was not originally designed).", "paper_title": "Interactive zero-knowledge with restricted random oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000236909300002"}
