Compounding of graphs is one such technique. In this article, by means of the compounding of complete graphs into a bipartite Moore graph of diameter 6, we obtain a family of large graphs of the same diameter. For maximum degrees Delta = 5,6,9,12, and 14, members of this family constitute the largest known graphs of diameter 6. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
