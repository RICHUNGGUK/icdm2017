A DIG is implemented on high resistivity Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) wafer. The image-guide height and handle layer thickness are 500 mu m and 130 mu m, respectively. An Aluminum coplanar waveguide is patterned over the DIG. The measured transmission characteristics of the transition are in acceptable agreement with the simulation results. A transition (coupling) loss of about 1 dB has been achieved at 60 GHz.
