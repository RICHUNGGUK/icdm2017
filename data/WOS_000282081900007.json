This problem in turn requires the calculation of the inverse of a random matrix. Over the past four decades several approximate analytical methods and simulation methods have been proposed for the solution of this problem in the context of probabilistic structural mechanics. In this paper we present a new solution method for stochastic linear equations. The proposed method is based on Neumann expansion and the recently developed joint diagonalisation solution strategy. Unlike the classical Neumann expansion, here only the inversion of a diagonal matrix is needed. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the use of the expressions derived in the paper.
