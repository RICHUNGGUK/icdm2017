In such cases, the objects of interest are typically represented by small, spatially cohesive clusters of pixels which are to be preserved or removed, depending on the requirements. When images are corrupted by the noise or contain intensity variations generated by imaging sensors, identification of these clusters within the intensity space is problematic as they are corrupted by outliers. This paper presents a novel approach to accounting for spatial organization of the pixels and to measuring the compactness of pixel clusters based on the construction of fuzzy measures with specific properties: monotonicity with respect to the cluster size; invariance with respect to translation, reflection, and rotation; and discrimination between pixel sets of fixed cardinality with different spatial arrangements. We present construction methods based on Sugeno-type fuzzy measures, minimum spanning trees, and fuzzy measure decomposition. We demonstrate their application to generating fuzzy measures on real and artificial images.", "paper_title": "Characterizing Compactness of Geometrical Clusters Using Fuzzy Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400023"}
