We model this uncertainty with non-probabilistic information-gap models of uncertainty. This paper focuses on info-gaps in epidemiological models, in particular, info-gaps in the rate of infection. robustness to uncertainty is defined as a function of the required critical morbidity resulting from the attack. We show how preferences among available interventions are deduced from the robustness function. We demonstrate the irrevocable trade-off between robustness and demanded performance, and show that best-estimated performance has zero robustness. Finally, we present a theorem concerning the reversal of preferences between available interventions, and illustrate it with a numerical example.", "paper_title": "An info-gap approach to policy selection for bio-terror response", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800056"}
