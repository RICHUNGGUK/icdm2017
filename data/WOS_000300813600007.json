The aim of this study is to examine these effects when standing up from three different seat heights. A musculoskeletal body model has been modified to simulate the three different seat heights. The calculated muscle forces have been transferred to a finite element model of a pelvis. The pelvis model was created from a hemipelvis CT dataset. As an implant component, a metal socket with a polyethylene insert was used. A primary implantation situation was modelled. For the analysed patient activities the highest hip contact forces and the highest micromotions occur at the beginning of the motion. The results of this study show that standing up from a certain seat height can have a significant influence on the micromotions in the implant-bone interface. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
