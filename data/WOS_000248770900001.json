This mixture is particularly useful for modeling discrete data (vectors of counts). The algorithm proposed is based on the expectation maximization (EM) approach. This mixture is used to improve image databases categorization by integrating semantic features and to produce a new texture model. For the texture modeling problem, the results are reported on the Vistex texture image database from the MIT Media Lab. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
