We show that there exist pairs of quantum channels, neither of which individually have any zero-error capacity whatsoever (even if arbitrarily many uses of the channels are available), but such that access to even a single copy of both channels allows classical information to be sent perfectly reliably. In other words, we prove that the zero-error classical capacity can be superactivated. This result is the first example of superactivation of a classical capacity of a quantum channel.", "paper_title": "Superactivation of the Asymptotic Zero-Error Classical Capacity of a Quantum Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000297807300034"}
