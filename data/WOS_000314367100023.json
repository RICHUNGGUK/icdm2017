A key aspect for routine clinical use of this technology is its degree of automation, i.e., the amount of necessary knowledgeable interaction between the clinicians and the registration system. Current image-based registration approaches usually require knowledgeable manual interaction during two stages: for initial pose estimation and for verification of produced results. We propose four novel techniques, particularly suited to vertebra-based registration systems, which can significantly automate both of the above stages. Two of these techniques are based upon the intraoperative \"insertion\" of a virtual fiducial marker into the preoperative data. The remaining two techniques use the final registration similarity value between multiple CT vertebrae and a single fluoroscopy vertebra. The proposed methods were evaluated with data from 31 operations (31 CT scans, 419 fluoroscopy images). Results show these methods can remove the need for manual vertebra identification during initial pose estimation, and were also very effective for result verification, producing a combined true positive rate of 100% and false positive rate equal to zero. This large decrease in required knowledgeable interaction is an important contribution aiming to enable more widespread use of 2D-3D registration technology.", "paper_title": "Increasing the Automation of a 2D-3D Registration System", "paper_id": "WOS:000314367100023"}
