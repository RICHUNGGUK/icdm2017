Hartmann, M. Meinke, W. Schroder, Differential equation based constrained reinitialization for level set methods, J. Comput. Phys. 227 (2008) 6821-6845] a new constrained reinitialization equation incorporating a forcing term is introduced. Two formulations for high-order constrained reinitialization (HCR) are presented combining the simplicity and generality of the original reinitialization equation [M. Sussman, P. Smereka, S. Osher, A level set approach for computing solutions to incompressible two-phase flow, J. Comput. Phys. 114 (1994) 146-159] in terms of high-order standard discretization and the accuracy of the constrained reinitialization scheme in terms of interface displacement. The novel HCR schemes represent simple extensions of standard implementations of the original reinitialization equation. The results evidence the significantly increased accuracy and robustness of the novel schemes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
