We analyse the continuous case, that corresponds to a set endowed with a topology that furnishes an idea of continuity, so that it becomes natural to ask for the existence of quantifications based on interval-valued mappings from the set of data into the real numbers under preservation of order and topology. In the present paper we solve a continuous represent ability problem for interval orders. We furnish a characterization of the representability of an interval order through a pair of continuous real-valued functions so that each element in X has associated in a continuous manner a characteristic interval or equivalently a symmetric triangular fuzzy number.", "paper_title": "Interval-valued representability of qualitative data: The continuous case", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175800003"}
