Some orders are required to go for processing in a particular factory. Based on a Just-In-Time (JIT) strategy, an objective function is defined for the production scheduling problem with a due window. A series of Lemmas and a polynomial-time algorithm are presented to determine the optimal due window and sequence. The algorithm is tested on data collected from the company. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
