The performance of OFDM system is severely degraded by the local oscillator phase noise, which causes both common phase error (CPE) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). In this paper, the phase noise suppression (PNS) algorithm in order to reduce the phase noise in OFDM-based 60 GHz WPANs is considered. The PNS algorithm is very simple and easily designed to realize system but it requires more effort to reduce the IC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
