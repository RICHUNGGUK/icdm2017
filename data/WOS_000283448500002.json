In this paper, we propose a novel fast image registration algorithm based on block matching. Unreliable motion vectors (i.e., not related with jitter movements) are properly filtered out by making use of ad-hoc rules taking into account local similarity, local \"activity,\" and matching effectiveness. Moreover, a temporal analysis of the relative error computed at each frame has been performed. Reliable information is then used to retrieve inter-frame transformation parameters. Experiments on real cases confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach even in critical conditions.", "paper_title": "A Robust Block-Based Image/Video Registration Approach for Mobile Imaging Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000283448500002"}
