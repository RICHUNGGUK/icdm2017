Determination and selection of the key feature(s) is crucial to the predictive performance of calibration models. Even with proper feature selection, the predictive performance of calibration models can be enhanced by filtering the raw spectral data. This improvement results because a filter removes the unwanted variation of predictor variables that is orthogonal to response variables. This is the first work that attempts to develop a systematic calibration model based oil genetic algorithm-based feature selection and orthogonal filtering. A case study shows that the proposed calibration model for shaft misalignment conditions produces better predictive performance than traditional multivariate statistical approaches such as principal component regression and partial least squares.
