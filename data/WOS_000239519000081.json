QTI 1.2 had some accessibility issues, as the VISUAL project discovered when transforming QTI tests into accessible HTML and voice user interfaces. Some problems were due to an insufficient mechanism to specify alternative text, other problems were due to the ambiguity of the intent of certain interaction types. QTI 2.0 solved the issue of alternative text, but the ambiguity with regard to the intent of interaction types was not sufficiently addressed.", "paper_title": "Accessibility issues in two specifications for e-learning tests: IMS QTI 1.2 and IMS QTI 2.0", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000081"}
