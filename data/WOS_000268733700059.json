This is a new means for investigating asymptotic behavior of stochastic differential equation. Some useful results are derived. Especially, our methods can be extended to research p-moment asymptotic behavior easily. At last, example and simulations demonstrate the power of our methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
