Two sufficient conditions about exponential stability of this class of BAM neural networks are given by using difference inequalities and Lyapunov function together with Razumikhin technique. Some examples are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the advantage of the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
