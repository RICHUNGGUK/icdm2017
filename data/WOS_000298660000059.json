The set of these graphs with 2n vertices is denoted by H-2n. By a new method proposed here, we obtain the first 7 graphs in the increasing order of their Hosoya indices within H-2n for n >= 8. In addition, complete increasing orders of graphs in terms of their Hosoya indices are also derived for four subsets in H-2n. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
