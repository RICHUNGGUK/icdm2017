Dynamic 3D video sequences are generated using computational binocular stereo matching with active illumination and are used for interactive expression modeling. An individual's 3D video set is annotated with control points associated with face subregions. Dragging a control point updates texture and depth in only the associated subregion so that the user generates new composite expressions unseen in the original source video sequences. Such an interactive manipulation of dynamic 3D face reconstructions requires as little preparation on the test subject as possible. Dense depth data combined with video-based texture results in realistic and convincing facial animations, a feature lacking in conventional marker-based motion capture systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
