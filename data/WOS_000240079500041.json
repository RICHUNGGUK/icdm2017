In the modeling, a multi-feature metrics (MFM) was firstly established to describe the local configuration; then the membership degree of MFM-based fuzzy subsets was defined, and the fuzzy recognition operator was constructed. The MFFR algorithm can correctly infer four kinds of vessel structures including vascular ends, segments, bifurcations and crossovers. The results are satisfying: on average 91.1% of the testing vessel lengths in medium quality images are automatically delineated as well as their structures being correctly inferred with point-wise.", "paper_title": "Inferring vascular structures in coronary artery X-ray angiograms based on multi-feature fuzzy recognition algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500041"}
