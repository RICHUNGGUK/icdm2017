The experimental results show that the proposed SDR-pipelined architecture can save power and hardware resource compared with conventional pipelined architecture, because the designed CVM and CRM modules can be reused in the processing modules of CFO estimation and compensation circuit. The performance trade-off for CVM and CRM implemented with different quantized float number in FPGA is presented. Furthermore, the hardware reconfiguration function of CVM and CRM is also validated.", "paper_title": "FPGA Implementation of SDR Based CFO Estimation and Compensation Circuit for OFDM System", "paper_id": "WOS:000299531400009"}
