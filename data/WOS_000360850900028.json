The calculation results indicate that the strongly donating, nucleophilic carbene center can engage in a variety of heterolytic splitting of E-H (E=H, C, N, O) bonds, some of which are reversible. The cleavage of E-H bonds across the Ni=C bond represents a new mode of bond activation by ligand cooperativity in nickel pincer complex. On the basis of the calculations, we also demonstrate that reversible H-2 activation across the Ir=C bond via the PCcarbeneP iridium pincer complex was observed in the experiments, while other E-H (E=C, N, O) bonds were not activated. Our calculations are in good agreement with experimental observations and could provide new insights into ligand cooperativity in nickel pincer complexes.", "paper_title": "Mechanistic insights into small molecule activation induced by ligand cooperativity in PCcarbeneP nickel pincer complexes: a quantumchemistry study", "paper_id": "WOS:000360850900028"}
