In this paradigm, the server simply broadcasts segments of a popular video periodically on a number of communication channels. A large number of clients can be served simultaneously by tuning into these channels to receive segments of the requested video. A playback can begin as soon as a client can access the first segment. Periodic Broadcast guarantees a small maximum service delay regardless of the number of concurrent clients. Existing periodic broadcast techniques are typically evaluated through analytical assessment. While these results are good performance indicators, they cannot demonstrate subtle implementation difficulty that can prohibit these techniques from practical deployment. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a video broadcasting system based on our periodic broadcast scheme called Striping Broadcast. Our experience with the system confirms that the system offers a low service delay close to its analytical guaranteed delay while requiring small storage space and low download bandwidth at a client.", "paper_title": "A scalable cost-effective video broadcasting system for on-demand video services", "paper_id": "WOS:000237658000004"}
