Sunflowers are a useful tool in polynomial-time data reduction for problems formalizable as d-Hitting Set, the problem of covering all hyperedges (whose cardinality is bounded from above by a constant d) of a hypergraph by at most k vertices. Additionally, in fault diagnosis, sunflowers yield concise explanations for \"highly defective structures\". We provide a linear-time algorithm that, by finding sunflowers, transforms an instance of d-Hitting Set into an equivalent instance comprising at most O(k (d) ) hyperedges and vertices. In terms of parameterized complexity, we show a problem kernel with asymptotically optimal size (unless ) and provide experimental results that show the practical applicability of our algorithm. Finally, we show that the number of vertices can be reduced to O(k (d-1)) with additional processing in O(k (1.5d) ) time-nontrivially combining the sunflower technique with problem kernels due to Abu-Khzam and Moser.", "paper_title": "Towards Optimal and Expressive Kernelization for d-Hitting Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000339341900008"}
