To guarantee the disturbance rejection ability of the closed loop system, most of the existing advanced control methods develop disturbance rejection control laws only for speed loop. To further improve the disturbance rejection ability, a control scheme which employs disturbance rejection control laws for not only speed loop but also the q-axis current loop, is developed here. Considering the dynamics of q-axis current, the coupling between rotor speed and d-axis current as well as the back electromotive force are regarded as lumped disturbances for the q-axis current loop, which are estimated by introducing an extended state observer (ESO). Thus a composite control law consisting of proportional feedback and disturbance feedforward compensation is developed to control the q-axis current. Simulation and experiment comparisons are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
