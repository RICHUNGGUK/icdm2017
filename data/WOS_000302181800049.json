The method is applied to the object-based interpolation of tomographic slices. For that purpose, the fidelity of a given deformation to the data is established by a block-matching strategy based on intensity-and gradient-related features, the smoothness of the transformation is favored by an appropriate prior on the field, and the deformation is guaranteed to maintain the topology by imposing some hard constraints on the local configurations of the field. The resulting deformation is defined as the maximum a posteriori configuration. Additionally, the relative influence of the fidelity and smoothness terms is weighted by the unsupervised estimation of the field parameters. In order to obtain an unbiased interpolation result, the registration is performed both in the forward and backward directions, and the resulting transformations are combined by using the local information content of the deformation. The method is applied to magnetic resonance and computed tomography acquisitions of the brain and the torso. Quantitative comparisons offer an overall improvement in performance with respect to related works in the literature. Additionally, the application of the interpolation method to cardiac magnetic resonance images has shown that the removal of any of the main components of the algorithm results in a decrease in performance which has proven to be statistically significant.", "paper_title": "A Markov Random Field Approach for Topology-Preserving Registration: Application to Object-Based Tomographic Image Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800049"}
