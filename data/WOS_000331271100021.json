One of the most widely used software packages for this purpose is AutoDock, which incorporates three metaheuristic techniques. We propose the integration of AutoDock with jMetalCpp, an optimization framework, thereby providing both single-and multiobjective algorithms that can be used to effectively solve docking problems. Results: The resulting combination of AutoDock + jMetalCpp allows users of the former to easily use the metaheuristics provided by the latter. In this way, biologists have at their disposal a richer set of optimization techniques than those already provided in AutoDock. Moreover, designers of metaheuristic techniques can use molecular docking for case studies, which can lead to more efficient algorithms oriented to solving the target problems.", "paper_title": "jMetalCpp: optimizing molecular docking problems with a C++ metaheuristic framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000331271100021"}
