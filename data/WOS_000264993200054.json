However, simple cells with only thalamic excitation exhibit tuning curves that widen with stimulus contrast. This is inconsistent with the contrast-invariant width actually observed. We propose a map formation model that achieves contrast invariance through anti-phase inhibition. We describe how inhibition between columns implements the coverage constraint to ensure orientations are uniformly sampled. We find that the model exhibits more robust receptive field formation than a simpler model without anti-phase inhibition. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
