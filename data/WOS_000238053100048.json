LMC is a new educational environment for young students to build and explore logic models in graphical form. LMC allows visual representation of logic models using IF/THEN/ELSE constructs. In this paper we provide an overview of LMC architecture and discuss briefly an example of use of LMC. As discussed, LMC users in the reported case study managed to achieve effective communication and task evaluation during exploration of problems involving decision making.", "paper_title": "An environment for constructing and exploring visual models of logic propositions by young students", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100048"}
