Gaussian basis RBF neural networks are used to approximate the nonlinear uncertainties, a high-gain observer is used to estimate the ball velocity which cannot be measured. A fixed controller and an adaptive robust controller derived can guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable and robust; the desired position tracking performance is achieved when the system parameters change. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Neural network based robust nonlinear control for a magnetic levitation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000259152300010"}
