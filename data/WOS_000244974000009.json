The system model is composed of the differential dynamic equation of the upper link and state equations of the controller. With plenty of numerical simulation, the regular angle swing and giant rotating motions of the two links are achieved and illustrated in time history trajectories, amplitude spectra and phase plane portraits, respectively. The effects of the controller parameters on swing motions, including controller time constants and system damping, are analyzed. Finally, the transition behaviors between the above two motion patterns are also studied.", "paper_title": "Rhythmic swing motions of a two-link robot with a neural controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000009"}
