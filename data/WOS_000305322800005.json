The experimental results in a real network environment show that our proposed architecture can not only support the seamless handover, but also guarantee the scalability because of its modulised design. Besides, an adaptive handover trigger scheme and an access network selection scheme are proposed to initiate the handover and select the target access network intelligently.", "paper_title": "Advanced handover management framework for Mobile Router based on MCoA", "paper_id": "WOS:000305322800005"}
