We provide criteria concerning the degree of vertices or the length of paths which can be used to show that a given graph does not belong to a certain level of this hierarchy. Each graph in the Caucal hierarchy corresponds to the configuration graph of some higher-order pushdown automaton. The main part of the paper consists of a study of such configuration graphs. We provide tools to decompose and reassemble their runs, and we prove a pumping lemma for higher-order pushdown automata. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V.
