This neurofuzzy approach represents an effective structure to the modeling of plant dynamics, and the oriented-object programming environments offer an intuitive way to address this task. In this paper the MODELICA object-oriented environment has been applied to the ANFIS modeling and indirect control of the heavy and light product composition in a binary methanol-water distillation column by using the adaptive Levenberg-Marquardt approach. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of the adaptive ANFIS scheme under MODELICA for the dual control of composition both for changes in set points with null stationary error even when disturbances are present.
