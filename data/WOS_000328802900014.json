Multiple images are necessary to reconstruct the tensor data and each acquisition is subject to complex thermal noise. As such, measures of tensor invariants, which characterize components of tensor shape, derived from the tensor data will be biased from their true values. Previous work has examined this bias, but over a narrow range of tensor shape. Herein, we define the mathematics for constructing a tensor from tensor invariants, which permits an intuitive and principled means for building tensors with a complete range of tensor shape and salient microstructural properties. Thereafter, we use this development to evaluate by simulation the effects of noise on characterizing tensor shape over the complete space of tensor shape for three encoding schemes with different SNR and gradient directions. We also define a new framework for determining the distribution of the true values of tensor invariants given their measures, which provides guidance about the confidence the observer should have in the measures. Finally, we present the statistics of tensor invariant estimates over the complete space of tensor shape to demonstrate how the noise sensitivity of tensor invariants varies across the space of tensor shape as well as how the imaging protocol impacts measures of tensor invariants.
