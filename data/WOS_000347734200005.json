In government administration, it is very time consuming to process different types of documents and there are many data input problems. There is also a need to satisfy citizens' requests to retrieve government information and to link these requests to build an online document without asking the citizen to input the data more than once. To provide an e-Government service which is easy to access, fast and secure, the e-Document plays an important role in the management and interoperability of e-Government Systems. To meet these challenges, this paper presents a Secure Multilayer e-Application (SMeA) method for improving e-Government processes. This method involves five steps: namely (i) identifying an e-Template; (ii) building a SMeA; (iii) mapping the data; (iv) processing the e-Application; and (v) approving the e-Application. The first step involves requirements analysis and the last four involve data analysis for building a SMeA. To demonstrate its usefulness, we applied SMeA to a case study of an application for a licence to set up a new business in Vietnam.", "paper_title": "A Secure Multi-Layer e-Document Method for Improving e-Government Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000347734200005"}
