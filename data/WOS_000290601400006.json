A scheme of typical reuse mode is designed from the perspectives of application engineering and domain engineering activities. According to the scheme, six reuse modes are addressed from the sequences of activities. Alternative industry reuse scenarios can be derived from, the modes. An optimization model is proposed that can assist decision-makers in selecting a reuse scenario for minimizing cost, maximizing reliability and satisfying system requirements. To solve efficiently the bi-objective 0-1 integer programming involved in the model, a new algorithm is presented that can find the entire set of efficient solutions.", "paper_title": "A MODEL AND ITS ALGORITHM FOR SOFTWARE REUSE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH SIMULTANEOUS RELIABILITY AND COST CONSIDERATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400006"}
