Many of these recommenders are centralized, lacking in efficiency and scalability, while others are distributed and, conversely, imply a computational overhead on the client side being often excessive or even unacceptable for many devices. In this article, we propose a distributed recommender, based on a multi-tiered agent system, where the agents of each tier are specialized in a different e-commerce activity. The proposed system is capable of generating effective suggestions without a too onerous computational burden. In particular, we show that our system introduces significant advantages in terms of openness, privacy, and security.", "paper_title": "Introducing specialization in e-commerce recommender systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000325096800003"}
