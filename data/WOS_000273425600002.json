We model the transportation network as a subset of the plane and take into account the fact that the customers minimize their own transportation cost. The underlying theory is a two-player game model called Stackelberg games. We propose algorithms for the cases where the fare does and does not depend on the distance traveled, in lthe L(1) or L(2) metrics. In particular, we propose an O(n log n) algorithm for optimal pricing of a highway under the L(2) metric, and an O (nk log n log(3) k) algorithm for orthogonally convex networks of complexity O(k) under the L(1) metric.", "paper_title": "PRICING GEOMETRIC TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273425600002"}
