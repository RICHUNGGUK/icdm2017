Assoc. Comput. Mach. 33( 4): 792-807, 1986) While the analysis is done in the model of exact security, we improve known bounds also asymptotically when many bits are output each round and we find all auxiliary parameters efficiently, giving a uniform result. These optimizations makes the analysis effective even for security parameters/key-sizes supported by typical block ciphers and hash functions. This enables us to construct very practical pseudo-random generators with strong properties based on plausible assumptions.", "paper_title": "Practical construction and analysis of pseudo-randomness primitives", "paper_id": "WOS:000252826900001"}
