These problems arise in many applications of practical interests. We present a proximal alternating linearization algorithm which alternately generates two approximate proximal points of the original objective function. It is proved that the accumulation points of iterations converge to a stationary point of the problem. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical convergence analysis and verify the implementation of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A proximal alternating linearization method for nonconvex optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000331336100005"}
