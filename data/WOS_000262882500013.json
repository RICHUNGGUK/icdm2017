Each job has to be setup by the server before being processed oil one of the machines. Three special cases: equal length jobs, equal processing times and regular equal setup times are considered and the asymptotic competitive ratios of list scheduling are determined. Also, a lower bound for the equal length job case is given. and two heuristics with tight asymptotic competitive ratios for the other two cases are proposed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
