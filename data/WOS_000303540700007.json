Density functional theory (DFT) has been employed to study the molecular geometries, electronic structures, infrared spectra, and thermodynamic properties at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Their detonation performances evaluated using the Kamlet-Jacobs equations with the calculated densities and heats of formation are superior to those of HMX. The predicted densities of them were ca. 2 g*cm(-3), detonation velocities were over 9 km*s(-1), and detonation pressures were about 40 GPa, showing that they may be potential candidates of high energy density materials (HEDMs). The natural bond orbital analysis indicated that N-NO2 bond is the trigger bond during thermolysis process. The stability of the title compounds is slightly lower than that of 2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (CL-20). The results of this study may provide basic information for the molecular design of new HEDMs.", "paper_title": "Molecular design of new nitramine explosives: 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-8-(nitromethyl)-4-imidazolino[4,5-b]4-imidazolino-[4,5-e] pyridine and its N-oxide", "paper_id": "WOS:000303540700007"}
