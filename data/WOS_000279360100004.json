Several topic representations have been employed for producing informative and coherent summaries. In this article, we describe five previously known topic representations and introduce two novel representations of topics based on topic themes. We present eight different methods of generating multidocument summaries and evaluate each of these methods on a large set of topics used in past DUC workshops. Our evaluation results show a significant improvement in the quality of summaries based on topic themes over MDS methods that use other alternative topic representations.", "paper_title": "Using Topic Themes for Multi-Document Summarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000279360100004"}
