However, finding the optimal emphasis adjustment is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose to make a fusion of the outputs of RA-we ensembles trained with different emphasis adjustments by means of a generalized voting scheme. The resulting committee of RA-we ensembles can retain the performance of the best RA-we component and even, occasionally, can improve it. Additionally, we present an ensemble selection strategy that removes from the committee RA-we ensembles with very poor performance. Experimental results show that these committees frequently outperform RA and RA-we with cross validated emphasis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
