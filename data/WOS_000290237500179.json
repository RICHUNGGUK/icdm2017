Once the control chart detects a process change, the next issue is to \"search for assignable causes\", or \"take corrective actions\", etc. Before corrective actions are taken, it is critical to search for the cause of the out-of-control situation. During this search process, knowledge of the current parameter level can be helpful to narrow the set of possible assignable causes. Sometimes, the process/product parameters might be adjusted following the out-of-control signal to improve quality. An accurate estimate of the parameter will naturally provide a more precise adjustment of the process. A distinct weakness of most existing control charts techniques is that they merely provide out-of-control signals without predicting the magnitudes of changes. In this paper, we develop a support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting the process mean shifts. Firstly, a cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart is employed to detect shifts in the mean of a process. Next, an SVR-based model is used to estimate the magnitude of shifts as soon as CUSUM signals an out-of-control situation. The performance of the proposed SVR was evaluated by estimating mean absolute percent errors (MAPE) and normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) using simulation. To evaluate the prediction ability of SVR, we compared its performance with that of neural networks and statistical methods. Overall results of performance evaluations indicate that the proposed support vector regression model has better estimation capabilities than CUSUM and neural networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
