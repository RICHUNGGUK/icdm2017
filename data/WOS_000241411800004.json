The paper models the distributed system with a graph that describes the communication capabilities of the constituting agents. This graph is referred to as the \"organizational graph.\" In addition, the desired task-performing activity is modeled with another graph describing the required communications. Then, a few variants of the task assignment problem are formulated with potentially conflicting objectives ( or constraints) of load balancing and communication costs. For some of these variants this paper provides efficient algorithms that solve the assignment problem. Some problems are proven NP-complete, and some others are left open.", "paper_title": "Some compartmentalized secure task assignment models for distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241411800004"}
