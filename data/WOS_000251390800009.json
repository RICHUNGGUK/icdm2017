A new MRA is introduced to describe higher-density DWT and used to obtain the sufficient condition for the HDDT Hilbert transform pair. In designing HDDT filters we use the extended common-factor method which not only includes the common-factor method but also provides exact linear phase bi-frame filters. Both HDDT tight frame and bi-frame ( anti) symmetric filter design methods are given. At last, the results of denoising experiments by our newly designed HDDT filters in this paper prove the effectiveness of higher-density dual-tree DWT in the application of image processing.", "paper_title": "Higher-density dual tree discrete wavelet transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390800009"}
