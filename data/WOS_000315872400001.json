A new emerging group of these devices is the wearable devices, and the wireless sensor networks are a good way to integrate them in the IoT concept and bring new experiences to the daily life activities. In this paper, we present an everyday life application involving a WSN as the base of a novel context-awareness sports scenario, where physiological parameters are measured and sent to the WSN by wearable devices. Applications with several hardware components introduce the problem of heterogeneity in the network. In order to integrate different hardware platforms and to introduce a service-oriented semantic middleware solution into a single application, we propose the use of an enterprise service bus (ESB) as a bridge for guaranteeing interoperability and integration of the different environments, thus introducing a semantic added value needed in the world of IoT-based systems. This approach places all the data acquired (e. g., via internet data access) at application developers disposal, opening the system to new user applications. The user can then access the data through a wide variety of devices (smartphones, tablets, and computers) and operating systems (Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, etc.).", "paper_title": "An Internet of Things Approach for Managing Smart Services Provided by Wearable Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000315872400001"}
