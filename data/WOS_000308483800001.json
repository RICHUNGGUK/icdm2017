This paper outlines an overview of current research and development in the field of OSP problems in a perspective of both researchers and engineers. The paper begins with a definition of the model of sensor placement and provides the basic issues covering relevant methodologies. The primary evaluation criteria and main sensor placement methods are then discussed in details. Following that, the linkage between several influential sensor placement methods is described. Finally, existing problems and promising research efforts in the OSP problem of civil SHM are discussed.", "paper_title": "Methodology Developments in Sensor Placement for Health Monitoring of Civil Infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000308483800001"}
