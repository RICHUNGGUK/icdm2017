In order to measure the approximation, we employ probability logic to construct the final Markov process and define a metric on the set of Markov processes through this logic. Moreover, we show that the set endowed with this metric is a Polish space. Finally we point to some questions connecting approximation to uniformity and approximate bisimilarity as topics for future research. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
