It is based on a Kripke semantics where the worlds are contexts, called context-semantics. This variation was obtained indirectly by simplifying an analysis of a fragment of polymorphic lambda-calculus [2]. We relate in this way works done in proof theory [4, 14] with a fundamental result in lambda-calculus.", "paper_title": "The completeness of typing for context-semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000248423100002"}
