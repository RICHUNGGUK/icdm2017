Despite this recent attention, many L1-regularized problems still remain difficult to solve, or require techniques that are very problem-specific. In this paper, we show that Bregman iteration can be used to solve a wide variety of constrained optimization problems. Using this technique, we propose a \"split Bregman\" method, which can solve a very broad class of L1-regularized problems. We apply this technique to the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi functional for image denoising and to a compressed sensing problem that arises in magnetic resonance imaging.", "paper_title": "The Split Bregman Method for L1-Regularized Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101100002"}
