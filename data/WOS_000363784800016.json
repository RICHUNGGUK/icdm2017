A family of semi-custom EEAL-based 32-bit carry-lookahead adder (CLA) has been designed in a TSMC 90-nm CMOS process technology and verified by CADENCE Design suite. Differential cascode voltage swing (DCVS) logic has been used to implement the newly proposed EEAL and it uses only a sinusoidal clock supply to ensure correct operation. Post-layout simulations show that semi-custom adiabatic arithmetic units can save significant amount of energy, as compared to the previously reported single clocked adiabatic logic and logically equivalent static CMOS implementation. Extensive CADENCE simulations have been done for the verification of the functionality of the proposed logic structure.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of 32-Bit CLA Using Energy Efficient Adiabatic Logic for Ultra-Low-Power Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000363784800016"}
