Wearable devices are normally designed to be miniature and portable. Models running on the devices inevitably face following challenges: low-computational-complexity, lightweight and high-accuracy. In order to meet these requirements, a novel powerful activity recognition model named b-COELM is proposed in this paper. b-COELM retains the superiorities (low-computational-complexity, lightweight) of Proximal Support Vector Machine, and extends the powerful generalization ability of Extreme Learning Machine in multi-class classification problems. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of b-COELM for recognizing activities of daily living. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
