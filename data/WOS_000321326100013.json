In order to distinguish the level phase in a vessel such as high, medium, and low a mechanism of Gaussian Filter Method was proposed in this study. The k-weights of the statistical features were adjusting by the k-NN Classifier and separate the categories for training from the various parameters. Within this study, 6 statistical used features were employed for training. In addition, a time-frequency parameter obtained by continuous signal was also used to identify the pulse during the recognition process. For the classification of all phase level, the average accuracy was higher than 90.0% for the whole data set. Finally, in order to provides the opportunity of obtaining quantitative and real time data on two phase media within a full scale industrial process, such as filtration, without the need of processes interruption, tomography methods answer it all.", "paper_title": "A study of a two phases medium in pipe vessel using gaussian filter method and k-NN classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000321326100013"}
