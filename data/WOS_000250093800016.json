This problem occurs when the payoff of each person conflicts with the total payoff of the community which he/she belongs to. Evolutionary game theory has been used as a powerful mathematical framework to analyze such a social problem. Recently, the authors have proposed replicator dynamics with reallocation of payoffs. In this model, the government is willing to lead the population to a desirable goal state by using collections and reallocations of payoffs. In this paper, we investigate this model, and show conditions for the goal state to be a locally or a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, respectively. We also propose a government's strategy depends on population states which can stabilize the goal state globally.", "paper_title": "Replicator dynamics with government's intervention by collection and reallocation of payoffs", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800016"}
