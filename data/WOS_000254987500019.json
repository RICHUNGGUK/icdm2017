An isochronal annealing is simulated to evidence the different thermally activated mechanisms that govern defect evolution. KMC simulations show that in the case of ion irradiation, additional recovery peaks should be expected, in comparison to electron irradiation conditions. A comparison between kMC and RT results indicates that some of these peaks are due to spatially - correlated recombinations that occur at low temperature. Therefore kMC and RT approaches differ at low temperature. However, at higher temperature results obtained by both models are in near perfect agreement. In addition, we studied the influence of vacancy cluster mobility on the evolution of damage. KMC simulations show that the mobility of V2, V3 and V4 clusters does not significantly affect the evolution of defects and can be neglected in these conditions.", "paper_title": "Cascade damage evolution: rate theory versus kinetic Monte Carlo simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000254987500019"}
