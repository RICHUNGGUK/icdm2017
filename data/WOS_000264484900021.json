A modular electronic system was designed which includes sensors communicating over a CAN bus and an on-board computer that runs a special real-time Linux kernel. The same system is reusable on other types of vehicles and on the ground stations, facilitating the development of multi-vehicle control algorithms.", "paper_title": "A Hardware Platform for Research in Helicopter UAV Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000264484900021"}
