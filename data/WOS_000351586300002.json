Inverse tone mapping methods have been proposed to convert low dynamic range (LDR) images to HDR ones, and several of them require multiple exposure LDR images of the same scene as inputs. However, the vast majority of LDR images and videos available have only one single exposure. In this paper, we propose a region-based enhancement of the pseudo-exposures to generate an HDR image. First, we present an exposure dependent curve to convert one LDR image to the pseudo-multiple-exposures. Only certain regions of the pseudo-exposures contain noticeable detail information. We propose a region-based enhancement on the pseudo-exposures to boost details in the most distinct region. Thereby the region-enhanced pseudo-exposures are fused into an HDR image. The fused image thus enhances details in the bright region of the dark image and the dark region of the bright image. Compared with other inverse tone mapped methods, our method generates lower total contrast error measured under the dynamic range independent image quality assessment method in [1].", "paper_title": "Pseudo-Multiple-Exposure-Based Tone Fusion With Local Region Adjustment", "paper_id": "WOS:000351586300002"}
