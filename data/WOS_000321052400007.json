In this note, we show that all the graphs with at most seven vertices are PCGs. In particular, all these graphs except for the wheel on seven vertices W-7 are PCGs of a particular structure of a tree: a centipede.", "paper_title": "All Graphs with at Most Seven Vertices are Pairwise Compatibility Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000321052400007"}
