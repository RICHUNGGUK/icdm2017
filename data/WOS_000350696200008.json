Most existing approaches for the parallel job execution time estimation, however, require ample past job traces and the explicit correlations between the job execution time and the outer layout parameters such as the consumed processor numbers, the user-estimated execution time and the job ID, which are hard to obtain or reveal. This paper presents and evaluates a novel execution time estimation approach for parallel jobs, the user-behavior clustering for execution time estimation, which can give more accurate execution time estimation for parallel jobs through exploring the job similarity and revealing the user submission patterns. Experiment results show that compared to the state-of-art algorithms, our approach can improve the accuracy of the job execution time estimation up to 5.6 %, meanwhile the time that our approach spends on calculation can be reduced up to 3.8 %.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Job Execution Time Estimation Approach Based on User Submission Patterns within Computational Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000350696200008"}
