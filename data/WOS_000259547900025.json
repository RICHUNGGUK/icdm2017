In this paper we propose a novel face recognition approach based on adaptively weighted patch pseudo Zernike moment array (AWPPZMA) when only one exemplar image per person is available. In this approach, a face image is represented as an array of patch pseudo Zernike moments (PPZM) extracted from a partitioned face image containing moment information of local areas instead of global information of a face. An adaptively weighting scheme is used to assign proper weights to each PPZM to adjust the contribution of each local area of a face in terms of the quantity of identity information that a patch contains and the likelihood of a patch is occluded. An extensive experimental investigation is conducted using AR and Yale face databases covering face recognition under controlled/ideal conditions, different illumination conditions, different facial expressions and partial occlusion. The system performance is compared with the performance of four benchmark approaches. The encouraging experimental results demonstrate that moments can be used for face recognition and patch-based moment array provides a novel way for face representation and recognition in single model databases.
