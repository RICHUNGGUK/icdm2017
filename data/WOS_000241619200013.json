The GSTCP asks for the assignment of sets of nonnegative integers to the vertices of a graph so that constraints on the separation of any two numbers assigned to a single vertex or to adjacent vertices are satisfied and some objective function is optimised. Among the various objective functions of interest, we focus on the minimisation of the span, that is, the difference between the largest and the smallest integers used. In practical applications large size instances of the GSTCP are to be solved and heuristic algorithms become necessary. In this article, we propose a new hybrid procedure for the solution of the GSTCP that combines a known tabu search algorithm with an algorithm for the enumeration of all feasible re-assignments of colours to a vertex. We compare the new algorithm with the basic tabu search algorithm and for both we study possible variants. The experimental comparison, supported by statistical analysis, establishes that the new hybrid algorithm performs better on a variety of instance classes.", "paper_title": "Colour reassignment in tabu search for the graph set T-colouring problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241619200013"}
