The proposed method needs a previous pre-processing step to transform interval symbolic data into modal symbolic data. The presented classifier has then as input a set of vectors of weights. In the learning step, each group is also described by a vector of weight distributions obtained through a generalization tool. The allocation step uses the squared Euclidean distance to compare two modal descriptions. To show the usefulness of this method, examples with synthetic symbolic data sets are considered.", "paper_title": "A modal symbolic classifier for interval data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100006"}
