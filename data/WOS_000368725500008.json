As the traditional mobile application development models do not support computation offloading, mobile cloud computing requires novel application development models that can facilitate the development of cloud enabled mobile applications. This paper presents a mobile cloud application development model, named MobiByte, to enhance mobile device applications' performance, energy efficiency, and execution support. MobiByte is a context-aware application model that uses multiple data offloading techniques to support a wide range of applications. The proposed model is validated using prototype applications and detailed results are presented. Moreover, MobiByte is compared with the most recent application models with a conclusion that it outperforms the existing application models in many aspects like energy efficiency, performance, generality, context awareness, and privacy.", "paper_title": "MobiByte: An Application Development Model for Mobile Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000368725500008"}
