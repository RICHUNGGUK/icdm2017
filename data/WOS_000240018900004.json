In the context of virtual screening, chemical databases to be screened are often initially represented by canonicalised SMILES strings that can be filtered and pre-processed in a number of ways, resulting in molecules that occupy similar regions of chemical space to active compounds of a therapeutic target. A wide variety of software exists to convert molecules into SMILES format, namely, Mol2smi (Daylight Inc.), MOE (Chemical Computing Group) and Babel (Openeye Scientific Software). Depending on the algorithm employed, the atoms of a SMILES string defining a molecule can be ordered differently. Upon conversion to 3D coordinates they result in the production of ostensibly the same molecule. In this work we show how different permutations of a SMILES string can affect conformer generation, affecting reliability and repeatability of the results. Furthermore, we propose a novel procedure for the generation of conformers, taking advantage of the permutation of the input strings-both SMILES and other 2D formats, leading to more effective sampling of conformation space in output, and also implementing fingerprint and principal component analyses step to post process and visualise the results.", "paper_title": "Permuting input for more effective sampling of 3D conformer space", "paper_id": "WOS:000240018900004"}
