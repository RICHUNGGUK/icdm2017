Analysis and experiment on Gaussian signal show that the performance of the proposed scheme can achieve larger gain than that of the two-stage SQ scheme because of better performance of TCQ. The proposed scheme for image coding is shown to be more effective than other relevant multiple description image coding schemes in terms of central-side-distortion rate performance.", "paper_title": "TWO-STAGE MULTIPLE DESCRIPTION IMAGE CODING USING TCQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000270696800009"}
