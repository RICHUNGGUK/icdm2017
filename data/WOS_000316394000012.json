However, difficulties in the control of maintenance transmission line robot exist due to multiple nonlinearities, plant parameter variations and external disturbances. This paper investigates the possibility of using neural network as a promising self-learning control alternative for the control problem of inspection and deicing transmission line robot. We first discuss the mechanical structure, as well as dynamic model of a deicing robot. And then, a neural network-based self-learning control strategy consists of a fuzzy neural network controller and an ELM-based single-layer-feedback neural networks identifier are proposed for this deicing transmission line robot. Both the structure and the learning algorithm of the control system are presented. The proposed controller is verified by computer simulations and experiments.", "paper_title": "Neural network-based self-learning control for power transmission line deicing robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000316394000012"}
