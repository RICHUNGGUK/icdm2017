The interface, called FpADI, defines the protocols, data structures and operational mechanism of the functions. The purpose of designing FpADI is to develop a minutiae-based fingerprint verification algorithm cooperatively and to evaluate the algorithm efficiently. In a preliminary experiment, fingerprint feature extraction algorithms are implemented using FpADI and an application program, called FpAnalyzer, is developed in order to evaluate the performance of the implemented algorithms by visualizing the information in the FpADI data structures.", "paper_title": "Design of algorithm development interface for fingerprint verification algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300045"}
