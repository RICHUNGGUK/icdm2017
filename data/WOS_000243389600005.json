This process is called Web service composition, and the resulted service is called composite Web service. The discovery and composition of Web services are two important research issues. In this article, a Web service composition system, BITS, which won the championship of the ICEBE05 contest due to its outstanding performance, is introduced. BITS is implemented based on a binary tree which is used to organize Web services. In this system, some search strategies and optimization techniques are developed for efficient service discovery and service composition. Extensive experiments are conducted for performance study, and the results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the methods adopted in BITS.", "paper_title": "BITS: A binary tree based web service composition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000243389600005"}
