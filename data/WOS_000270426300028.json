The nonconvexity and the mixed constraints are the two significant characters of the problem considered in this paper. Under a suitable assumption on the constrained set and a proper assumption on the objective function V(x, y), it is proved that for a sufficiently large penalty parameter, there is unique global solution to the neural network, and the unique trajectory of the neural network can reach the feasible region in finite time and stays there thereafter. Moreover, we can prove that the trajectory of the neural network converges to the set consisted by the equilibrium points of the network, whose elements are all the critical saddle points of the problem. Moreover, we prove the coincidence between the unique solution to the neural network modeled by a differential inclusion and the \"slow solution\" of it. Furthermore, one illustrative example shows the correctness of the results in this paper, and the good performance of the proposed neural network.", "paper_title": "A NEURAL NETWORK FOR SMOOTH NONCONVEX SADDLE POINT PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000270426300028"}
