ECGR takes full advantage of cooperative diversity and geographic routing. At physical layer, cooperative nodes transmit the same packet in a cooperative way to achieve farther transmission distance of each hop without more energy consumption. While at the network layer, ECGR adaptively selects the appropriate cooperative nodes to form forwarding clusters to forward the packet to the destination when we consider energy consumption and geographic information of the sensor nodes. Meanwhile, in order to fully assess the energy consumption, we take circuit energy consumption of the sensor nodes into consideration. According to the description above, we increase the transmit distance of each hop; and thereby reducing and balancing the overall network energy consumption among nodes to extend the lifetime of the network.", "paper_title": "An energy-efficient geographic routing based on cooperative transmission in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323202000003"}
