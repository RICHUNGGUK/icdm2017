These measurements give information about the electrochemical processes in tissues and can be used to characterize the tissue or monitor for physiological changes. Traditionally these parameters are extracted using fitting routines on direct measurements of the impedance. Here, a method of non-linear least squares fitting (NLSF) is applied to extract the single and double-dispersion Cole impedance parameters from collected current-excited step response datasets without requiring direct impedance measurements. The impedance parameters are extracted from MATLAB simulations showing less than 1% and 5.5% for the single and double dispersion parameters, respectively, when a 0.5% random noise component is present. This extraction is verified experimentally using apples as Cole impedances showing less than 2% relative error between simulated responses (using the extracted impedance parameters) and the experimental results over the entire dataset.
