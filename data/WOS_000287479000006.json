We determine the analytic formula that describes the fine balance between Regulatory T cells and T cells at controlled and immune response equilibrium states. We demonstrate that cytokine dependent growth exhibits a quorum T cell population threshold that determines if immune responses develop on activation. We determine the analytic formulas of T cell proliferation thresholds that allow us to study the sensibility of the quorum growth thresholds controlling immune responses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
