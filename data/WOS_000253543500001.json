Many existing systems have either explicitly or implicitly followed this paradigm. Instead of exchanging files, peers in FSP systems share their computation resources in order to offer domain-specific services. In this paper, we focused on the coordination problem of how to self-organize the service group structures in response to the varying service demand. We presented our solution in the form of a coordination mechanism, which includes a labor-market model, a recruiting protocol, and a policy-driven decision architecture. Peers make their service providing decisions based on their local policies, which can be added, removed, or modified by users. A general methodology is introduced in this paper to facilitate policy design. Specifically, a heuristic inspired by the Extremal Optimization technique is utilized to handle potential inconsistencies among policies. A stimulus-response mechanism was further applied to make the decision process adjustable. Experiments under five application scenarios verified our ideas and demonstrated the effectiveness of our coordination mechanism.", "paper_title": "Coordinated service provision in peer-to-peer environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000253543500001"}
