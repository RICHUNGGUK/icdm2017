The technique uses virtual, attractive forces derived from the surrounding free space. Fuzzy logic is utilised to limit the 'free-space' force so as to promote the movement towards the goal. The algorithm was designed to be a robust technique for reactive navigation that could be implemented without the fuss of tuning the sensitive parameters required for other classical navigation routines. Several simulations plus some preliminary experimental results are presented here to demonstrate the algorithm's potential. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
