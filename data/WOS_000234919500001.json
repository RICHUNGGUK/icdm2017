The effect of multiple defects or zones of damage in a section is considered. Although defects initiate and grow randomly, failure may occur at the section where the environmental attack is most severe rather than at the section where the load effect is largest. The strength of a wall is determined by the section with the least safety margin. A nonuniform distribution of stresses at a section leads to a reduction in strength that is a nonlinear function of section area lost. The methods are illustrated using a low-rise reinforced concrete wall subjected to flexure and shear forces in which the outer part of the cross-section area is lost due to expansive aggregate reactions.", "paper_title": "Reliability assessment of reinforced concrete walls degraded by aggressive operating environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000234919500001"}
