We used the top 100 Turkish universities and the top 10 Turkish companies in 10 industrial sectors in order to observe the performance of web impact indicators. Total page count metric is obtained through Google Turkey and the pure link metrics have been gathered from Open Site Explorer. The indicators obtained both for web presence and web visibility indicated that there are significant differences between the group of academic institutions and those related to companies within the web space of Turkey. However, this current study is exploratory and should be replicated with a larger sample of both Turkish universities and companies in each sector. Likewise, a longitudinal study rather than sectional would eliminate or smooth fluctuations of web data (especially URL mentions) as a more adequate understanding of the relations between Turkish institutions, and their web impact, is reached.", "paper_title": "Revealing the online network between university and industry: the case of Turkey", "paper_id": "WOS:000365130100025"}
