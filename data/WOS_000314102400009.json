This study shows that the above stochastic system has a global positive solution with probability 1 and establishes the sufficient conditions for stability of the zero solution and the positive equilibrium. Several numerical examples are introduced to illustrate the results. Some recent results are improved and generalized. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
