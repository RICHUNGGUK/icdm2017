A model transformation method is utilized to approximate the time-varying delay in T-S fuzzy delta operator systems. By applying the scaled small gain (SSG) theorem and Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and has an induced L-2 disturbance attenuation performance. The existence condition of the dynamic output-feedback controller can be solved via convex optimization problems. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Output-Feedback Control for T-S Fuzzy Delta Operator Systems With Time-Varying Delays via an Input-Output Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400028"}
