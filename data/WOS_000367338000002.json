In building CAPS, our aim has been to make the IDE accessible to non-experts while retaining the overall flavor of the pen-and-paper calculational style. We discuss the overall architecture of the CAPS system, the main features of the IDE, the GUI design, and the trade-offs involved.", "paper_title": "Building an IDE for the Calculational Derivation of Imperative Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000367338000002"}
