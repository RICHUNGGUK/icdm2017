The casual assumptions on the boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of neuronal activation functions are relaxed. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and using the characteristic function technique, passivity conditions are cast in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be checked numerically using an LMI toolbox. Based on these conditions, two procedures for designing passification controllers are proposed, which guarantee that MRNNs with time-varying delays are passive. Finally, two illustrative examples are presented to show the characteristics of the main results in detail.", "paper_title": "Passivity and Passification of Memristor-Based Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000344089300013"}
