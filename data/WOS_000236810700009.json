When the generator set is chosen properly, they are isomorphic to Cayley graphs of the wreath product Z(m) ? S-n. In the case of m >= 3 and n >= 3, we investigate their different algebraic properties and give a routing algorithm, with the diameter upper bounded by 9/8n(2) - 1/4n + 2. Some embedding properties are also derived. Finally. we compare the proposed networks with some popular topologies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
