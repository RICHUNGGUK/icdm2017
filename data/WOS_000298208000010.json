The authors share the findings and observations of an experimental study in which they subjected operating computers to high steady-state temperatures and thermal cycling well beyond their design specifications. The results suggest that significant cost savings can be realized without compromising reliability.", "paper_title": "Long-Term Thermal Overstressing of Computers", "paper_id": "WOS:000298208000010"}
