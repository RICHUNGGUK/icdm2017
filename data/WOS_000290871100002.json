A problem, scarcely addressed so far, is how to distribute video streaming traffic from one source to all nodes in an urban vehicular network. This problem significantly differs from previous work on broadcast and multicast in ad hoc networks because of the highly dynamic topology of vehicular networks and the strict delay requirements of streaming applications. We present a solution for intervehicular communications, called Streaming Urban Video (SUV), that 1) is fully distributed and dynamically adapts to topology changes, and 2) leverages the characteristics of streaming applications to yield a highly efficient, cross-layer solution.", "paper_title": "Video Streaming Distribution in VANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290871100002"}
