Conventional hard real-time scheduling theories use framework of rate monotonic analysis (RMA) to schedule such I/O blocking tasks. However. most of them are pessimistic. In this paper. we propose effective algorithms that can schedule a task set which has I/O blocking tasks tinder dynamic priority assignment. We present a new critical instant theorem for the multi-frame task set under dynamic priority assignment. The schedulability is analyzed tinder the new critical instant theorem. For the schedulability analysis, this paper presents saturation summation which is used to calculate the maximum interference function (MIF). With saturation summation. the schedulability of a task set having I/O blocking tasks can be analyzed more accurately. We propose all algorithm which is called Frame Laxity Monotonic Scheduling (FLMS). A genetic algorithm (GA) is also applied. From Our experiments. we can conclude that FLMS call significantly reduce the calculation time. and GA can improve task schedulability ratio more than is possible with FILMS.", "paper_title": "Effective Scheduling Algorithms for I/O Blocking with a Multi-Frame Task Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200010"}
