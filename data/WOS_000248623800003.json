Concurrently, a neural networks approach was used to develop a corresponding nonlinear model. The descriptors appearing in these models are discussed with respect to the physical nature of the UV absorption phenomenon.", "paper_title": "QSPR modeling of UV absorption intensities", "paper_id": "WOS:000248623800003"}
