We describe a numerical method, based on the spectral decomposition of vector/tensor components onto spherical harmonics, that allows for the evolution of only those scalar fields which correspond to the divergence-free degrees of freedom of the vector/tensor. The full vector/tensor field is recovered at each time-step from these two (in the vector case), or three (symmetric tensor case) scalar fields, through the solution of a first-order system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) for each spherical harmonic. The correspondence with the poloidal-toroidal decomposition is shown for the vector case. Numerical tests are presented using an explicit Chebyshev-tau method for the radial coordinate.
