The proposed protocol uses the concepts of CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) and CP (carrier preemption) to all-optically transfer the IP packets of the nodes in the WDM ring networks. This paper studies the length effect of FDL (fiber delay line) in each node to support variable packet transmission, and develops an analytical model to analyze and simulate the packet delay and throughput.
