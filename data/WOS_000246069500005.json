Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) is another class of methods for reducing the noise of simulation estimators, by sampling more evenly than with standard MC. It typically works well for simulations that depend mostly on very few random numbers. In splitting and IS, on the other hand, we often simulate Markov chains whose sample paths are a function of a long sequence of independent random numbers generated during the simulation. In this article, we show that RQMC can be used jointly with splitting and/or IS to construct better estimators than those obtained by either of these methods alone. We do that in a setting where the goal is to estimate the probability of reaching B before reaching (or returning to) A when starting A from a distinguished state not in B, where A and B are two disjoint subsets of the state space, and B is very rarely reached. This problem has several practical applications. The article is in fact a two-in-one: the first part provides a guided tour of splitting techniques, introducing along the way some improvements in the implementation of multilevel splitting. At the end of the article, we also give examples of situations where splitting is not effective. For these examples, we compare different ways of applying IS and combining it with RQMC.", "paper_title": "Rare events, splitting, and quasi-Monte Carlo", "paper_id": "WOS:000246069500005"}
