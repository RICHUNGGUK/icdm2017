We use the multiscale representation as the cornerstone of the modeling process, and construct the MARMA models of SAR image. We then predict the initialized image data using these multiscale models. Next we compress image data through coding the residual image. Extension simulations have proven that the proposed method achieves high compression radios with impressive image quality.", "paper_title": "A new method for compression of SAR imagery based on MARMA model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100097"}
