This has the goal of building a foundation for future research on ERPs and how stakeholders' desire to achieve competitive advantage influence ERP development, especially when it comes to development of a more standardised or pre-customised ERP system. The propositions also act as a foundation for increasing our knowledge concerning the difficulty in developing improved ERP systems.", "paper_title": "Competitive advantage in the ERP system's value-chain and its influence on future development", "paper_id": "WOS:000274021000004"}
