This improvement can only be achieved with the support of comprehensive systems that fully monitor business processes. We propose an occurrence-based approach to business process monitoring that provides a holistic perspective of system dynamics, lending support to evolution aspects. More specifically, we present a three-dimensional artifact, called Occurrence, in which structure, behavior, and guidance are considered simultaneously. Based on this, we define more complex structures, namely Occurrence Base and Occurrence Management System, which serve as scaffolding to develop business process monitoring systems. We also present a specific occurrence-based design strategy that, using an MDE approach, has been applied by our research group for the development of successful monitoring applications.", "paper_title": "Occurrence-Oriented Design Strategy for Developing Business Process Monitoring Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340205700016"}
