In many assemblies, functionality is also dependent on external and internal forces. Numerous Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) tools have been proposed that address tolerance analysis problems in complex mechanical assemblies: however current tools do not accommodate a general class of problem where the functionality of a design is fundamentally dependent on the effects of external and internal forces. This research addresses the limitation of CAT tools to accommodate assemblies under loading by developing a tolerance analysis platform which integrates CAD. CAE and statistical analysis tools using Process Integration and Design Optimisation (PIDO) software capabilities. The platform extends the capabilities of traditional CAT tools by enabling tolerance analysis of assemblies in which assembly characteristics are dependent on external and internal forces. To demonstrate the capabilities of the developed platform, examples of tolerance analysis problems involving external forces (compliance) and internal forces (multi-body dynamics) are presented.
