If an unconsidered case does arise during execution, program behavior falls through the cracks into unspecified behavior. We investigate rule-based, end-user strategy programming by introducing our Interactive Football Playbooka domain specific, end-user programming environment to allow American football coaches to create animated football scenarios by associating strategy information with virtual football players. We address the problem of rule explosion through \"rule bending\" to support a minimalist, scaffolding-driven programming environment. Additionally, we introduce visual language representations for logical and sequential \"and\" to mitigate end-user confusion with the semantic meaning of these \"and\" constructs.
