In each pathway, enzymes catalyze the conversion of substrates into structurally similar products. Thus, structural similarity provides a potential means for mapping newly identified biochemical compounds to known metabolic pathways. In this paper, we present TrackSM, a cheminformatics tool designed to associate a chemical compound to a known metabolic pathway based on molecular structure matching techniques. Validation experiments show that TrackSM is capable of associating 93% of tested structures to their correct KEGG pathway class and 88% to their correct individual KEGG pathway. This suggests that TrackSM may be a valuable tool to aid in associating previously unknown small molecules to known biochemical pathways and improve our ability to link metabolomics, proteomic, and genomic data sets.
