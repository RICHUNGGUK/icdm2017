We obtain the following three results. (i) For the maximization knapsack problem, we propose a (k + 1)/k-competitive online algorithm, and show that it is the best possible, i.e., no online algorithm can have a competitive ratio less than (k 1)/k. (ii) For the minimization knapsack problem, we show that no online algorithm can have a constant competitive ratio. (iii) We extend the result in (i) to the resource augmentation model, where an online algorithm is allowed to use a knapsack of capacity m (>1), while the optimal algorithm uses a unit capacity knapsack.
