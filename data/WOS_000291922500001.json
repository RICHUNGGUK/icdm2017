However, this well-known performance is obtained under the implicit constraint that the code assigned to the whole n-block is a prefix code. Dropping the prefix constraint, which is rarely necessary at the block level, we show that the minimum expected length for a finite-alphabet memoryless source with known distribution grows as nH - 1/2 log n + O(1) unless the source is equiprobable. We also refine this result up to o(1) for those memoryless sources whose log probabilities do not reside on a lattice.", "paper_title": "Minimum Expected Length of Fixed-to-Variable Lossless Compression Without Prefix Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500001"}
