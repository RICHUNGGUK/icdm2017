The main ingredient is polynomial reconstruction based on local interpolations of mean values providing accurate approximations of the solution up to the sixth-order accuracy. First developed with the harmonic operator, an extension for the biharmonic operator is obtained, which allows designing a very high-order finite volume scheme where the solution is obtained by solving a matrix-free problem. An application in elasticity coupling the two operators is presented. We consider a beam subject to a combination of tensile and bending loads, where the main goal is the stress critical point determination for an intramedullary nail.", "paper_title": "A SIXTH-ORDER FINITE VOLUME METHOD FOR THE 1D BIHARMONIC OPERATOR: APPLICATION TO INTRAMEDULLARY NAIL SIMULATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000362229500007"}
