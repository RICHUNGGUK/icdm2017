We present an optical relay system that allows mechanical or electronic color spectrum control and use it to modify a conventional camera and projector. We use a diffraction grating to disperse the rays into different colors, and introduce a mask (or LCD/DMD) in the optical path to modulate the spectrum. We analyze the trade-offs and limitations of this design, and demonstrate its use in a camera, projector and light source. We propose applications such as adaptive color primaries, metamer detection, scene contrast enhancement, photographing fluorescent objects, and high dynamic range photography using spectrum modulation.", "paper_title": "Agile spectrum imaging: Programmable wavelength modulation for cameras and projectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500061"}
