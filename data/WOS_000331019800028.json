The target reliability of the system is achieved through application of an effective reliability apportionment technique to its subsystems. There are various traditional methods exist to perform the reliability allocation based on engineering factors that are assessed in a subjective manner. The conventional reliability allocation approach requires the assessment of factors like complexity, cost, and maintenance. This may not be realistic in real applications if they are assessed in a crisp manner by the domain experts of their varied expertise and background. In this paper, we treat allocation factors as fuzzy numbers, which are evaluated in fuzzy linguistic terms. As a result, fuzzy proportionality factor scales are proposed for the subsystems. In order to accomplish fuzzy division to evaluate the fuzzy proportionality factor, an approximation method based on linear programming for trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is also proposed in this paper. For the evaluation of weighting factors from fuzzy proportionality factors, centroid method of defuzzification is being employed. The allocated reliability of each subsystem is computed with the help of weighting factor thereafter. An example is provided to illustrate the potential application of the proposed fuzzy based reliability allocation approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
