We present a two-player game called gomino, and we show how this game induces an algorithm to generate these sets of polyominoes according to their site-perimeter. We then use a variation of the gomino algorithm to obtain exact expressions for the number of polyominoes inscribed in a rectangle of size b x k with area bk - r, where r <= 5. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
