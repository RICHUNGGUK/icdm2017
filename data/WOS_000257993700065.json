Since the characteristic of the resource constraint, call admission control is required to address the limited resource problem in wireless network. The call dropping probability and call blocking probability are the major performance metrics for quality of service (QoS) in wireless network. Many call admission control mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to decrease connection dropping probability for handoffs and new call blocking probability in cellular communications. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive call admission control and bandwidth reservation scheme using fuzzy logic control concept to reduce the forced termination probability of multimedia handoffs. Meanwhile, we adopt particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique to adjust the parameters of the membership functions in the proposed fuzzy logic systems. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve satisfactory performance when performance metrics are measured in terms of the forced termination probability for the handoffs, the call blocking probability for the new connections and bandwidth utilization.
