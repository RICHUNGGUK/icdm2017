Toward this end, this paper presents a novel approach for user-targeted video content association (VCA). In this approach, the salient objects are extracted automatically from the video stream using complementary saliency maps. According to these salient objects, the VCA system can push the related logo images to the users. Since the salient objects often correspond to important video content, the associated images can be considered as content-related. Our VCA system also allows users to associate images to the preferred video content through simple interactions by the mouse and an infrared pen. Moreover, by learning the preference of each user through collecting feedbacks on the pulled or pushed images, the VCA system can provide user-targeted services. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively and efficiently extract the salient objects. Moreover, subjective evaluations show that our system can provide content-related and user-targeted VCA services in a less intrusive way.", "paper_title": "Salient object extraction for user-targeted video content association", "paper_id": "WOS:000285586900004"}
