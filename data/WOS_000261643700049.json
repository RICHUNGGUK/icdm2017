By constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals and using stochastic analysis we give a family of sufficient conditions ensuring the almost sure exponential stability of the networks. These results obtained are helpful to design stability of networks when stochastic noise is taken into consideration. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
