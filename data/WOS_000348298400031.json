Optical orthogonal signature pattern codes (OOSPCs) have attracted wide attention as signature patterns of spatial CDMA. An (m, n, k, lambda)-OOSPC is a set of m x n (0, 1)-matrices with Hamming weight k and maximum correlation value lambda. Let Theta (m, n, k, lambda) be the largest possible number of codewords among all (m, n, k, lambda)-OOSPCs. In this paper, we concentrate on the calculation of the exact value of Theta (m, n, 3, 1) and the construction of an (m, n, 3, 1)-OOSPC with Theta (m, n, 3, 1) codewords. As a consequence, we show that Theta (m, n, 3, 1) = left perpendicularmn-1/6right perpendicular - 1 when mn equivalent to 14, 20 (mod 24), or mn equivalent to 8, 16 (mod 24) and gcd(m, n, 4) = 2, or mn equivalent to 2 (mod 6) and gcd(m, n, 4) = 4, and Theta (m, n, 3, 1) = left perpendicularmn-1/6right perpendicular otherwise.", "paper_title": "(m, n, 3, 1) Optical Orthogonal Signature Pattern Codes With Maximum Possible Size", "paper_id": "WOS:000348298400031"}
