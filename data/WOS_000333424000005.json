To this aim, we introduce accepting networks of evolutionary picture processors and investigate their computational power. We show that these networks can accept the complement of any local picture language as well as picture languages that are not recognizable. Some open problems regarding decidability issues and closure properties are finally discussed.", "paper_title": "Accepting Networks of Evolutionary Picture Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000333424000005"}
