They have been studied by artists and architects since the early fifteenth century. Computer graphics opens the door to anamorphic 3D geometry. We are not bound by physical reality nor a static canvas. Here we describe a simple method for achieving anamorphoses of 3D objects by utilizing a variation of a simple projective map that is well-known in the computer graphics literature. The novelty of this work is the creation of anamorphic 3D digital models, resulting in a tool for artists and architects.", "paper_title": "Anamorphic 3D geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000245521200012"}
