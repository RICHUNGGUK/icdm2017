Almost previous low-latency anonymous communication systems such as Tor, MorphMix, etc., that can be used to implement hidden services are vulnerable against end-to-end traffic analysis attack. This paper introduces Ferris wheel, a novel architecture for implementing hidden services which is robust against end-to-end traffic analysis attack. Moreover, our scheme is more robust against various traffic analysis attacks than previous low-latency anonymous communication architectures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
