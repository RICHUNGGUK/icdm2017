The LES approach in parallel implementation follows a dynamic k - Delta subgrid-scale (SGS) model in which the SGS stress is modelled by the eddy viscosity hypothesis using the sub-grid scale turbulent kinetic energy. The results show a geometric central recirculation zone because of the bluff body configuration and a near-wall recirculation region for all the cases considered. The swirling flames also developed a toroidal recirculation zone with a collar-like shear structure around it that ended up in a vortex-breakdown bubble (VBB) for the case of moderate swirl number. As the degree of swirl was increased, the VBB increased in size and strengthened up to create a large central recirculation zone. It was shown that these regions with flow reversal enhance the air and fuel mixing and thus, improve the entire combustion process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
