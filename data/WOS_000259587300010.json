Influence of some mechanical and geometrical parameters on bone stress distribution is highlighted and risk indicators relevant to critical overloading of bone are introduced. Insertions both in mandibular and maxillary molar segments are analyzed, taking into account different crestal bone loss configurations. Stress-based performances of five commercially-available dental implants are evaluated, demonstrating as the optimal choice of an endosseous implant is strongly affected by a number of shape parameters as well as by anatomy and mechanical properties of the site of placement. Moreover, effectiveness of some double-implant devices is addressed. The first one is relevant to a partially edentulous arch restoration, whereas other applications regard single-tooth restorations based on non-conventional endosteal mini-implants. Starting from computer tomography images and real devices, numerical models have been generated through a parametric algorithm based on a fully 3D approach. Furthermore, effectiveness and accuracy of finite-element simulations have been validated by means of a detailed convergence analysis. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
