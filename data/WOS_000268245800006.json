The proposed algorithm requires only linear operations but no eigen-decomposition or singular value decomposition into the signal and noise subspaces. Comparing with its ESPRIT counterpart (Wong and Zoltowski, IEEE J Oceanic Eng 22:566-575, 1997a), the proposed propagator algorithm has its computational complexity reduced by this ratio: the number of sources to quadruple the number of vector hydrophones. Simulation results show that at high and medium signal-to-noise ratio, the proposed propagator algorithm's estimation accuracy is similar to its ESPRIT counterpart.", "paper_title": "Computationally efficient underwater acoustic 2-D source localization with arbitrarily spaced vector hydrophones at unknown locations using the propagator method", "paper_id": "WOS:000268245800006"}
