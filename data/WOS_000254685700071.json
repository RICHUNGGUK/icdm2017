Two different approaches dealing with the incompressibility constraint will be compared, too. Then, every technique is tested on several relevant test cases in order to make a comparison. The surface tension treatment is evaluated for each method and every front-capturing method is tested on a case where interface deformations have something in common with turbulent behaviour. Finally, every method is studied through a phase inversion problem, which is an unsteady test case. Front-capturing methods are tested on physical cases where Navier-Stokes and advection equations are coupled in a non-linear way.
