Another immediate implication is constant spectral gap between the first and second eigenvalues of the random walk matrix associated with these graphs. We also show that the expected frugality (overpayment in the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism for shortest paths) of a sparse Erdos-Renyi random graph is bounded by a small constant.
