As the number of available Web services has increased, finding a method for locating appropriate services has become an important issue. For this purpose, many works for semantic Web service discovery have been proposed. Since they lack a precise scheme for specifying and matching service advertisements and user requirements, semantic mismatches can occur in service discovery. This paper presents a sophisticated method of discovering Web services. The proposed method facilitates specifying semantics precisely and flexibly based on the proposed integrated concept model. Additionally, more sophisticated discovery is supported by computing many-to-many complex matching relationships between ontological concepts. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs more efficiently for various kinds of user requests, as compared to previous works.", "paper_title": "A sophisticated approach to semantic Web services discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000255702100006"}
