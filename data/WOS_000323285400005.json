In this paper, we construct a deterministic network by a mapping method based on a recursive graph, and analyze its topological characteristics, including degree distribution, clustering coefficient, network diameter, average path length and degree correlations. We obtain that this network has the small-world property and positive correlation. The network modeling as we present gives a new perspective on networks, and helps to understand better the evolutions of the real-life systems, making it possible to explore the complexity of complex systems.", "paper_title": "A NETWORK MODEL GENERATED FROM THE RECURSIVE GRAPH BASED ON POLYGON", "paper_id": "WOS:000323285400005"}
