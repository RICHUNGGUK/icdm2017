In an actual environment, background noise includes not only wideband noise but also sinusoidal noise, such as ventilation fan and engine noise. In this paper, we propose a new noise reduction system which uses two types of adaptive line enhancers (ALE) and a noise estimation filter (NEF). First, the two ALEs are used to estimate speech components. The first ALE is used to reduce sinusoidal noise superposed on speech and wideband noise, while the second ALE is used to reduce wideband noise superposed on speech. However, since the quality of the speech enhanced by two ALEs is not good enough due to the difficulty in estimating unvoiced sound using the two ALEs, the NEF is used to improve on noise reduction capability. The NEF accurately estimates the background noise from the signal occupied by noise components, which is obtained by subtracting the speech enhanced by two ALEs from noisy speech. The enhanced speech is obtained by subtracting the estimated noise from noisy speech. Furthermore, the noise reduction system with feedback path is proposed to improve further the quality of enhanced speech.", "paper_title": "A noise reduction system for wideband and sinusoidal noise based on adaptive line enhancer and inverse filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508900021"}
