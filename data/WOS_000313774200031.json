This approach provides two major contributions: (1) increased synchronization efficiency, especially for parameters tracing and (2) a simpler controller design. Two simulated cases are presented for comparison: Case 1 utilizes normal adaptive synchronization, whereas Case 2 utilizes the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model-based Lorenz systems to realize adaptive synchronization via the new adaptive scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our new adaptive strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
