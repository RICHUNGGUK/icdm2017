Detection of Antinucleolar Antibodies (ANAs) in patient serum is performed using a laboratory technique named Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF) followed by manual evaluation on the acquired slides from specialized personnel. In this procedure, several limitations appear and several automatic techniques have been proposed for the task of ANA detection. In this work we present a method achieving state-of-the-art performance on a publicly available dataset. More precisely, two powerful and rotation invariant descriptors are incorporated into a two stage classification scheme where the feature vectors are represented and fused in the dissimilarity space. Then, in a second level dissimilarity vectors are classified using a linear SVM classifier. Evaluation on the HEp-2 cell contest dataset yields a 70.16% performance on cell-level classification. Furthermore we provide results in Image Level Classification where a 78.57% classification rate was achieved.", "paper_title": "HEp-2 Cell Classification Using Descriptors Fused into the Dissimilarity Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000336744300008"}
