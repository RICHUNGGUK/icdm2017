Our experimental results on simulated datasets of DNA sequences show that when compared with other filtration algorithms, our filtration algorithm has better performance on the efficiency to filter out those positions of the text at which the pattern does not occur approximately. Moreover, our hybrid filtration strategy further improves the effectiveness of our filtration algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
