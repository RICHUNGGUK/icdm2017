We study the round-trip time, whose distribution depends strongly on the number of passengers waiting at the lobby, as well as the number of stops and the highest reversal floor. The distribution functions of the passenger queue length in the lobby, the round-trip time, the waiting time, the ride time and the journey time are derived. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
