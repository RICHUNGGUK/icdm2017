The open-loop gain or some other system parameter is changed monotonically. The admissible uncertainties are considered along their envelope. The worst uncertainty is denoted as that one where a specified function of the eigenvalues leads to the maximum disadvantageous effect on the closed-loop stability performance. Leaps in the dynamic behavior occur even for infinitesimally small changes in the gain parameter when system uncertainties are considered that are located especially at their bounds.", "paper_title": "Leap Effects among Robust Root Trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000295452300004"}
