We introduce reversible forms of prime event structures and asymmetric event structures. In order to control the manner in which events are reversed, we use asymmetric conflict on events. We prove a number of results about reachable configurations; for instance, we show under what conditions reachable configurations which are finite are reachable by purely finite means. We discuss, with examples, reversing in causal order, where an event is only reversed once all events it caused have been reversed, as well as forms of non-causal reversing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
