Here, we evaluated four visualization methods for see-through vision that can aid the user to recognize occluded objects in outdoor scenes intuitively: \"elimination of occluding objects,\" \"ground grid,\" \"overlaying model of occluding object,\" and \"top-down view.\" As we used a new handheld MR device for outdoor see-through vision, we performed subjective experiments to determine the best combination of methods. The experimental results indicated that a combination of showing the ground grid, overlaying wireframe models of occluding objects, and top-down view to be optimal, while it was not nec-essary to display occluding objects for outdoor see-through vision with a handheld device, because users can see them with the naked eye.", "paper_title": "Visualization methods for outdoor see-through vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300003"}
