We show that the continuous versions are polynomial even if B is part of the input, but that the integral versions are polynomial only when B <= 3. However, when B <= 3 we show how to solve the problems using ordinary Max Flow/Min Cut. We also give tight bounds on the integrality gaps between the integral and continuous objective values for both problems, and between the continuous objective values for the bounded-length paths version and the version allowing all paths. We give a primal dual approximation algorithm for both problems whose approximation ratio attains the integrality gap, thereby showing that it is the best possible primal dual approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Max Flow and Min Cut with bounded-length paths: complexity, algorithms, and approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000280154400015"}
