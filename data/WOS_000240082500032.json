A QCNF formula (i.e., with CNF-matrix) is called minimal false, if the formula is false and any proper subformula is true. It is shown that the minimal falsity problem is PSPACE-complete. Then the deficiency of a QCNF formula is defined as the difference between the number of clauses and the number of existentially quantified variables. For quantified Boolean formulas with deficiency one, MF is solvable in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Minimal false quantified Boolean formulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000240082500032"}
