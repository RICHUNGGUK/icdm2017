Recently, the focus is set toward the development of different wind turbine technologies to enhance the FRT capability of wind parks with no consideration for transmission system protection schemes. This paper proposes a new communication-based dual time-current-voltage (Dual-TCV) tripping characteristic for directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) that considers the FRT capability of wind parks by taking fast fault isolation actions in transmission systems. The protection coordination problem is formulated and solved to determine the optimal relay tripping settings. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 24-bus transmission system with up to eight DFIG-based wind parks. The outcome of this study reveals that protection schemes based on DOCRs governed by the proposed Dual-TCV tripping characteristic ensures fast fault isolations that significantly enhances the FRT operation of wind parks in adherence to grid code requirements. The transient analysis verifies the superior performance of the proposed protection approach in enhancing the FRT operation of wind parks.", "paper_title": "A New Protection Scheme Considering Fault Ride Through Requirements for Transmission Level Interconnected Wind Parks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366141100008"}
