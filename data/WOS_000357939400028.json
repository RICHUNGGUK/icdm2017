They are classified into constant-weight OOCs (CW-OOCs) and variable-weight OOCs (VW-OOCs) according to the number of distinct Hamming weights which their codewords have. In this paper, we present a new generic construction of VW-OOCs of length (q - 1) N from a CW-OOC of length N, where q is a prime power and gcd(q - 1, N) = 1. As a result, three new families of optimal VW-OOCs with a maximum correlation value 1 are obtained. In particular, these families can have the codewords of high weights, while most of the previously known optimal VW-OOCs have only codewords of weight less than 8.", "paper_title": "New Families of Optimal Variable-Weight Optical Orthogonal Codes With High Weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000357939400028"}
