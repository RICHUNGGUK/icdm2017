The mathematical description was performed using the Lotka-Volterra model and the corresponding parameters were estimated by genetic algorithms. The proposed methodology shows itself capable of estimating market equilibrium and market concentration, the latter expressed by corresponding market shares. Evaluation of the presented methodology in the area of fixed lines telecommunications market led to accurate results, as compared to historical data, in a specific case study. This methodology can provide valuable inputs for managerial decisions, strategic planning and regulatory decisions to the players of a high technology market. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
