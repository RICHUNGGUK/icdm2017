E-learning specifications usually rely on domain-specific languages that describe different aspects of such final e-learning applications. This fact makes it natural to adopt well-established language engineering principles during the construction of these applications. These principles promote the specification of the structure and the runtime behavior of the domain-specific languages as the central part of the development process. This specification can be used to drive different activities: rapid prototyping, provision of authoring notations and tools, automatic model checking of properties, importation/exportation from/to standards, and deployment of running applications. This language engineering concept also promotes active collaboration between instructors (the users of the languages) and developers (the designers and implementers) throughout the development process. In this paper we describe this language-driven approach to the Construction Of e-learning applications and we illustrate all its aspects using a learning now sequencing language as a case study.
