In this paper, a novel planar 2-DOF parallel kinematic machine with kinematic redundancy is proposed and a method for redundant force optimization is presented to improve the precision of the machine. The inverse kinematics is derived, and the dynamic model is modeled with the Newton-Euler method. The deformations of the kinematic chains are calculated and their relationship with kinematic error of the machine is established. Then the size and direction of the redundant force acting on the platform are optimized to minimize the position error of the machine. The dynamic performance of the kinematically redundant machine is simulated and compared with its two corresponding counterparts, one is redundantly actuated and the other is non-redundant. The proposed kinematically redundant machine possesses the highest position precision during the motion process and is applied to develop a precision planar mobile platform as an application example. The method is general and suitable for the dynamic modeling and redundant force optimization of other redundant parallel kinematic machines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
