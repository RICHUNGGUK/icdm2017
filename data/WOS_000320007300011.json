However, it is severely affected by the noise uncertainty. To solve this problem, a blind multiband spectrum sensing scheme which is robust to noise uncertainty is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme performs spectrum sensing over the total frequency channels simultaneously rather than a single channel each time. To improve the detection performance, the proposal jointly utilizes the likelihood function combined with Gerschgorin radii of unitary transformed covariance matrix. Unlike the conventional sensing methods, our scheme does not need any prior knowledge of noise power or PU signals, and thus is suitable for blind spectrum sensing. In addition, no subjective decision threshold setting is required in our scheme, making it robust to noise uncertainty. Finally, numerical results based on the probability of detection and false alarm versus SNR or the number of samples are presented to validate the performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Robust Spectrum Sensing for Blind Multiband Detection in Cognitive Radio Systems: A Gerschgorin Likelihood Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000320007300011"}
