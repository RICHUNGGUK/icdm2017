In this paper, we exploit a novel learning-based framework. Given a video sequence, only a few characteristic frames are selected by the proposed selection algorithm, and then the likelihood to trained models is calculated in a pair-wise way, and finally segmentation is obtained as the optimal model sequence to realize the maximum likelihood. The average accuracy on IXMAS dataset reached to 80.5% at frame level, using only 16.5% of all frames in computation time of 1.57 s per video which has 1160 frames on the average.
