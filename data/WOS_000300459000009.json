In this model, CNN works as a trainable feature extractor and SVM performs as a recognizer. This hybrid model automatically extracts features from the raw images and generates the predictions. Experiments have been conducted on the well-known MNIST digit database. Comparisons with other studies on the same database indicate that this fusion has achieved better results: a recognition rate of 99.81% without rejection, and a recognition rate of 94.40% with 5.60% rejection. These performances have been analyzed with reference to those by human subjects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
