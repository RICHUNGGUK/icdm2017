Fundamentally new fault-tolerant architectures are required in order to produce reliable systems that will operate correctly. Simple replication of micro-architecture blocks will no longer suffice, as all replicated blocks will have faults. The history index of correct computation (HICC) is examined in a recursive and non-recursive fault-tolerant approach at the bit and module levels to identify reliable blocks on-the-fly and forward their computation results, while ignoring results from unreliable blocks. Simulation results show that recursive and non-recursive HICC offers the best resilience to faults when faults are non-uniformly distributed among redundant blocks. A correct computation rate of 99% is achieved using the recursive HICC when decision units at the bit and module levels are fault free, despite an average fault injection rate of 20% compared to a 68% correct computation rate for the recursive triple modular redundancy voter. When faults are injected everywhere in the design, the non-recursive HICC supports the best correct computation percentage. The effect of circuit size and history indices are also examined and discussed.", "paper_title": "Fault tolerance for nanotechnology devices at the bit and module levels with history index of correct computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000292591600001"}
