For the unweighted case, we prove that a local-search algorithm yields a PTAS. For the weighted case, we suggest a novel rounding scheme based on an LP relaxation of the problem, which leads to a constant-factor approximation. Most previous algorithms for maximum independent set (in geometric settings) relied on packing arguments that are not applicable in this case. As such, the analysis of both algorithms requires some new combinatorial ideas, which we believe to be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "Approximation Algorithms for Maximum Independent Set of Pseudo-Disks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306432400006"}
