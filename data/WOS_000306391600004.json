The current IMS service invocation mechanism, however, requires the Serving-Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) invokes each Application Server (AS) sequentially to perform service subscription profile, which results in the heavy load of the S-CSCF and the long session set-up delay. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a linear chained service invocation mechanism to invoke each AS consecutively. By checking all the initial Filter Criteria (iFC) one-time and adding the addresses of all involved ASs to the \"Route\" header, this new approach enables multiple services to be invoked as a linear chain during a session. We model the service invocation mechanisms through Jackson networks, which are validated through simulations. The analytic results verify that the linear chained service invocation mechanism can effectively reduce session set-up delay of the service layer and decrease the load level of the S-CSCF.
