A hybrid model built by means of a multiagent system that incorporates an unsupervised connectionist intrusion detection system (IDS) has been defined to guaranty an efficient computer network security architecture. This hybrid IDS facilitates the intrusion detection in dynamic networks, in a more flexible and adaptable manner. The proposed improvement of the system in this paper includes deliberative agents characterized by the use of an unsupervised connectionist model to identify intrusions in computer networks. This hybrid IDS has been probed through several real anomalous situations related to the simple network management protocol as it is potentially dangerous. Experimental results probed the Successful detection of such attacks through MOVIH-IDS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
