A 'grabbing lemma' of Mubayi and Rodl shows hat this property is typically inherited locally: if G((k)) is (rho, xi)-uniform, then all but exp{-s(1/k)/ 20}((n)(s)) sets S is an element of (([n])(s)) span (rho,xi')-uniform subhypergraphs G((k))[S], where. xi' -> 0 as xi -> 0, s >= s(0)(xi') and n is sufficiently large. In this article, we establish a grabbing lemma for a different concept of hypergraph uniformity, and infer the result above as a corollary. In particular, we improve, in the context above, the error exp{-s(1/k)/ 20} to exp{-cs}, for a constant c = c(k, xi') > 0. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
