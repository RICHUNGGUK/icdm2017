Parasitic effects due to coupling to the low-resistivity silicon substrate are eliminated by the introduction of a customized wet etching post-processing technique. The maskless post-processing technique consists of a wet etching step using open windows through the nitride layer that covers the silicon substrate. The etchant used to etch the silicon substrate is tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The best etching recipe that meets the PolyMUMPs requirements is determined. A variety of RF passive components are designed, fabricated, and tested. A comparison between the measurement results both before and after application of the proposed post-processing is presented.", "paper_title": "Suspended on-chip RF MEMS components fabricated using PolyMUMPs technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000237755700010"}
