In order to make and validate timely and relevant new contributions, the wider community requires accessible evaluation, experimentation and demonstration environments with specification comparable to the subsystems of the most massive datacenter networks. We demonstrate NetFPGA, an open-source platform for rapid prototyping of networking devices with I/O capabilities up to 100Gbps. NetFPGA offers an integrated environment that enables networking research by users from a wide range of disciplines: from hardware -centric research to formal methods.", "paper_title": "NetFPGA - Rapid Prototyping of Networking Devices in Open Source", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200053"}
