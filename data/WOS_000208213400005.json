This article identifies and describes security problems in the SIP protocol that may lead to denial of service. Such security problems include flooding attacks, security vulnerabilities in parser implementations, and attacks exploiting vulnerabilities at the signaling-application level. A qualitative analysis of these security flaws and their impacts on SIP systems is presented.", "paper_title": "SURVEY OF SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000208213400005"}
