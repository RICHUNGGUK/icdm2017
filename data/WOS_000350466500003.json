For noisy, agnostic settings we present a strategy for learning pointwise-competitive classifiers from a finite training sample provided that the classifier can abstain from prediction at a certain region of its choice. For some interesting hypothesis classes and families of distributions, the measure of this rejected region is own to be diminishing at rate beta(1).O ((polylog(m).log(1/delta)/m)beta(2)/2 with high probability, where in is the sample size, delta is the standard confidence parameter, and beta(1), beta(2) are smoothness parameters of a Bernstein type condition of the associated excess loss class (related to F and the 0/1 loss). Exact implementation of the proposed learning strategy is dependent on an ERM oracle that is hard to compute in the agnostic case. We thus consider a heuristic approximation procedure that is based on SVMs, and show empirically that this algorithm consistently outperforms a traditional rejection mechanism based on distance from decision boundary.", "paper_title": "Agnostic Pointwise-Competitive Selective Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000350466500003"}
