We regard certain sets of Mobius transformations as a generalized notion of digits and introduce sufficient conditions that such a \"digit set\" yields an admissible representation of [0, +infinity]. Furthermore, we establish the productivity and correctness of the homographic algorithm for such \"admissible\" digit sets. We present the Stem-Brocot representation and a modification of same as a working example throughout. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
