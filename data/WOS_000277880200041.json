An important step of the NGCA procedure is identification of the non-Gaussian subspace using principle component analysis (PCA) method. This article proposes a new approach to NGCA called sparse NGCA which replaces the PCA-based procedure with a new the algorithm we refer to as convex projection.", "paper_title": "Sparse Non-Gaussian Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200041"}
