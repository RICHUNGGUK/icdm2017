This trend enables a wide variety of emerging applications, for example, mobile location search, landmark recognition, scene reconstruction, and touristic recommendation, which range from purely research prototype to commercial systems. In this article, we give a comprehensive survey on these applications, covering recent advances in recognition and mining of geographical-aware social multimedia. We review related work in the past decade regarding to location recognition, scene summarization, tourism suggestion, 3D building modeling, mobile visual search and city navigation. At the end, we further discuss potential challenges, future topics, as well as open issues related to geo-social multimedia computing, recognition, mining, and analytics.", "paper_title": "When Location Meets Social Multimedia: A Survey on Vision-Based Recognition and Mining for Geo-Social Multimedia Analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000353638800001"}
