The sorting process in the disassembly system is the first process of the whole inverse manufacturing system. Therefore, it can become a bottleneck and decrease the productivity of the whole inverse manufacturing systems. This study focuses on a disassembly system with reverse blocking in a sorting process [Yamada, T., & Matsui, M. (2003). Disassembly production systems and its design issues. Reprints of Japan Industrial Management Association, Spring meeting, Chofu, Japan, May, 144 145 (in Japanese)]. It generalizes the queuing model and discusses the performance of the disassembly system by mathematical and numerical analysis. First, the sorting process with reverse blocking is generally modeled as a queuing system. Next, the stationary state equations of the system are formulated, and the objective function is set as the throughput. Finally, the system performance is discussed by mathematical and numerical analysis in cases of a different number of stations and buffers, and also an example of the system design is shown and discussed in view of the busy rate, blocking probability and throughput.
