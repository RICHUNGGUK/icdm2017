Evidence is provided that the basic cellular machinery possesses virtuality, Accordingly, one can step beyond the commonplace metaphor of computation as applied to molecular biology, and come to view the cell as a genuine computing system. The human nervous system is analyzed in the same light, setting an agenda for research on virtuality in recurrent neural networks, whose Outcomes in the way of theoretical results and simulation of biological neural systems may heuristically guide neuroscientists in the search for virtual computing in the brain.
