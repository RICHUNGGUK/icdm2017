When dealing with variable data, one usually employs the (X) over bar chart and R chart ( or S chart) to detect the process mean and process variance change. These charts are easy to understand and effectively communicate critical process information without using words and formulae. In this paper, we develop a new multiple-process performance analysis chart (MPPAC), using the process loss index L-e to control the product quality and/or reliability for multiple manufacturing processes. Upper confidence bounds are applied to the L-e MPPAC to ensure the capability groupings are accurate, which is essential to product quality assurance. The L-e MPPAC displays the multiple-process relative inconsistency and process relative off-target degree on one single chart in order to provide simultaneous capability control for multiple processes. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed L-e MPPAC incorporating the upper confidence bounds by presenting a case study on some liquid-crystal display module manufacturing processes, to evaluate the factory performance.", "paper_title": "Multiple-process performance analysis chart based on process loss indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000239237800001"}
