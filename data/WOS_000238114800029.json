Using the recently proposed ADF (Aggregation, Disaggregation and Filtering) model as well as entropy as metric for Web traffic characterization, we evaluate how locality of reference changes as the streams of requests pass through a hierarchy of caches. Moreover, we propose the use of average entropy for comparing the locality of reference of different streams and present how a proxy server can dynamically calculate the entropy of its incoming request stream.", "paper_title": "Locality of reference in an hierarchy of Web caches", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800029"}
