The filtered equations are discretised using the finite volume method in an unstructured, collocated grid arrangement with a second-order accurate method, in both space and time. The predictions are compared against very detailed experiments for mean velocities and Reynolds stresses that were performed in a duct of cross-section 72 mm x 72 mm using the PIV technique. The effects of mesh refinement close to the cylinder as well as of subgrid scale model are also examined. The numerical predictions are in very good agreement with the measurements in terms of mean as well as turbulence quantities. The instantaneous flow patterns of the flow field are examined and the effect of the external flow pulsation on the wake characteristics such as vortex formation length, vortex strength, Strouhal number as well as the lift and drag coefficients is quantified. The vortex formation length is decreased while the mean drag, as well as the rms values of the drag and lift coefficients increase significantly under pulsating flow conditions. The performance of the LES technique is analysed in the light of the wake characteristics. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
