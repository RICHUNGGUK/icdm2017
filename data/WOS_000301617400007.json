Direct numerical simulations are performed in a two-dimensional horizontal channel of expansion ratio ER = 2 at step level. The effects of the temperature difference between the heated bottom wall and the inflow temperature are investigated by keeping constant the Richardson number at 1. The covered range of Grashof and Reynolds numbers is respectively 3.31 x 10(4) <= Cr <= 2.72 x 10(5) and 182.03 <= Re <= 521.34. The thermal and dynamical instabilities which cause the onset of unsteady flow are described in detail. A spectral and phase portrait analysis of the temperature time series allows us to observe that the transition from steady to chaotic flow occurs by period-doubling bifurcations.
