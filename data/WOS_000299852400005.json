Also, for the cases that self-synchronization is not achieved through the coupling coefficient, a feedback control law for synchronization using the Lyapunov method is investigated. The performance of the proposed control law is compared with that of an existing one in the literature. Simulation results are provided. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
