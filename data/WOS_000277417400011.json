This paper deals with the problem of designing a robust repetitive-control system based on output feedback for a class of plants with time-varying structured uncertainties. A continuous-discrete two-dimensional hybrid model is established that accurately describes the features of repetitive control so as to enable independent adjustment of the control and learning actions. A sufficient condition for the robust stability of the repetitivecontrol system is given in terms of a linear matrix inequality. The condition is then used to obtain the parameters of the repetitive controller. Finally, a numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "Design of robust output-feedback repetitive controller for class of linear systems with uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000277417400011"}
