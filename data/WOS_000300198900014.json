However, the scale invariant property of these moments has not been studied due to its complexity of the problem. In this paper, we present a method to construct a set of scale and rotation invariants extracted from radial Tchebichef moments, named radial Tchebichef moment invariants (RTMI). Experimental results show the efficiency and the robustness to noise of the proposed method for recognition tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
