The proposed approach extends an existing method, which is suitable for the Clayton model, to general AC models. Asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics under the true model assumption are derived. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed test has reasonable performance. Finally, two real data examples are analyzed for illustrative purposes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
