So far, publicly available data sets used for modeling Pgp transport included compounds tested in different assays, different cell lines, and different protocols. In this work, we present a collection of 478 Efflux Ratios (ERs) in MDCK-MDR1 cell lines, and from this collection we define a data set of 187 compounds that were tested in the Borst-derived MDCK-MDR1 cell lines. Of the 23 models resulting from the use of different descriptors, classification algorithms, and variable selection techniques, the 4 most accurate in external validation (similar to 0.86) are based on VolSurf+ (VS+) descriptors. Two of these models are Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers using 4 descriptors that were selected through a new technique hereby first time extensively described.", "paper_title": "QSAR Models for P-Glycoprotein Transport Based on a Highly Consistent Data Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000308958400014"}
