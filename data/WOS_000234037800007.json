This is due to interference phenomena between the input small signal at f(s) = f(o)/2 and the converted signal again at f(o) - f(s) = f(s) = f(o)/2; the interference is dependent on the phase relation between the input small signal and the LO. The conversion matrix with f(s) = f(o)/2 is used in the design of frequency dividers by two. The conversion equations have been rewritten for the case of f(s) = f(o)/2, and the conversion matrix has been found to assume a real-imaginary form. Consequently, Barkhausen's criterion has been reassessed for this case. Experiments are performed that confirm this formalism, and computer simulations based on a nonlinear model for the nonlinear device are presented, showing similar results.
