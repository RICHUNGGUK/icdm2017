We discuss its points of strength, with respect to analytical models, and its weaknesses. The latter are mainly related to how the results of a simulation model can be interpreted, and how the structural parameters of the model can be estimated. We then show how these problems can be dealt with.", "paper_title": "Agent-based computational economics: a short introduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000303835000003"}
