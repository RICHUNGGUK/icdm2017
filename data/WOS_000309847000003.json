The proposed algorithm basically consists of two parts. The first part is the slot assignment for single node, which minimizes delay and jitters for dynamically arrived message streams and optimizes stream acceptation ratio. The second part is the slot assignment for multi-hop network, which guarantees every node having a path to the base station for its data delivery. In the path, sufficient resource is reserved and QoS can be guaranteed. For different applications, we use a dynamic programming technique to optimize TDMA frame length in accordance with their QoS requirements. The proposed algorithm is further optimized for dealing with unreliable links and dynamic traffic demands. It is evaluated and compared with existing slot assignment algorithms. The results show that our algorithm provides lower end-to-end delay and jitter, but higher throughput. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
