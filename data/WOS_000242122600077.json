Monitoring and decision support of process plant operation is one of the typical application examples. Graphical representation of two temporal signals in a two variables plane often characterizes special features of data. This paper presents an effective online method to extract qualitative representation of movements in a two variables plane. The method is applied to a diagnosis of a control valve in an industrial plant.", "paper_title": "On-line extraction of qualitative movements for monitoring process plants", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600077"}
