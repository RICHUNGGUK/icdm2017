Conclusively, our results suggest that weight-based variable selection is more useful for market segmentation than full-based and SEM-based variable selection. Additionally, a two-level SOM is more accurate in classification than K-means and SOM. The critical segmentation variables and the characteristics of target customers were different among countries. Therefore, online game companies should develop diverse marketing strategies based on characteristics of their target customers using research framework we propose.", "paper_title": "Comparative analysis of clustering methodology and application for market segmentation: K-means, SOM and a two-level SOM", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800050"}
