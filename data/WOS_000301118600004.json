As any other asset, knowledge provides value to organizations only when it conforms to a set of specifications and standards; in other words, when it is of good quality. Several proposals have addressed the issue of quality of knowledge, but there is not a widely accepted way of measuring such a concept. This article introduces a new approach to measure explicit knowledge in a semi-automatic way using software agents. The ideas described in this article are part of the e-Decisional Community concept, an agent-based platform for sharing experiential knowledge. The results of this research process show that it is possible to obtain a percentage of knowledge that represents an approximate measure of an individual's knowledge.", "paper_title": "Quality Assessment of Experiential Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000301118600004"}
