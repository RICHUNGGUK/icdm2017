Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method is used to simulate seven interconnected sub-basins in a regional river system located in Iran. Simulated predictions of the method are compared with historical data measurements. ANFIS is a powerful tool for simulating water resources systems of all sub-basins. In this study, a new methodology, Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning (ANFRL) is presented for obtaining optimal values of the decision variables. By combining ANFIS with Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning within the content of historical data over a consecutive monthly management period, ANFRL method was derived. Based upon the results of this research, this methodology can be used to develop fuzzy rule systems that accurately simulate the behavior of complex river basin systems within the context of uncertainty. As previous researches have shown that, when simulation model accurately reproduces observed river basin behavior, the optimization model yields better results. Application of this approach in the present case study shows that the effects of uncertainty, imprecise and random factors are 21, 11 and 15% over water resources system, water demand estimated and hydrological regime, respectively. Finally, the results of this method showed that about 16% improvement in water allocation was attained when compared to the primary water resources management in this case study.
