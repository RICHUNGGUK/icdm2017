We propose unknown-server-to-known-server topology-aware distance metrics based on the knowledge of network paths to both unknown and known servers at the autonomous systems level of Internet organization. The throughput value we want to predict for an unknown-server is approximated by the value achievable for the known-servercalled the best onewith the least value of unknown-server-to-known-server distance metrics. The best server is selected using the nearest neighbor algorithm. The usefulness of this method for Web-performance prediction has been confirmed in real-life experiments. The results of the work allowed us to formulate positive recommendations for applying this approach to efficient gaining of Web resources in replicated content systems, file mirrors, content delivery networks, and digital libraries.", "paper_title": "Using autonomous system topological information in a Web server performance prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000258370700007"}
