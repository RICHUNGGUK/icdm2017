Our system is exact, meaning that all internal numeric predicates are exactly decided in the sense of exact geometric computation. Our BSP-tree based system is 16-28 x faster at performing iterative computations than CGAL's Nef Polyhedra based system, the current best practice in robust Boolean operations, while being only twice as slow as the non-robust modeler Maya. Meanwhile, we achieve a much smaller substrate of geometric subroutines than previous work, comprised of only 4 predicates, a convex polygon constructor, and a convex polygon splitting routine. The use of a BSP-tree based Boolean algorithm atop this substrate allows its to explicitly handle all geometric degeneracies without treating a large number of cases.", "paper_title": "Fast, Exact, Linear Booleans", "paper_id": "WOS:000268597500003"}
