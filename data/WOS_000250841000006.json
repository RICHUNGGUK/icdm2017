Galerkin least squares technique of stabilization of the finite element method is investigated and its modification is described. A number of numerical results is presented. Properties of stabilization are discussed. Most important part is the study of the accuracy of the stabilized solution by means of a posteriori error estimates. (C) 2007 IMACS.
