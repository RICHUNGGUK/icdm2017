For sources with absolutely continuous distributions the high rate asymptotics of the quantizer distortion has long been known for alpha = 0 (fixed-rate quantization) and alpha = 1 (entropy-constrained quantization). These results have recently been extended to quantization with Renyi entropy constraint of order alpha >= r + 1. Here we consider the more challenging case alpha is an element of [-infinity, 0) boolean OR (0, 1)and for a large class of absolutely continuous source distributions we determine the sharp asymptotics of the optimal quantization distortion. The achievability proof is based on finding (asymptotically) optimal quantizers via the companding approach, and is thus constructive.", "paper_title": "High-Resolution Scalar Quantization With Renyi Entropy Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000038"}
