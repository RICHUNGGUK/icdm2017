We present a new algorithmic process which computes all the concepts, without requiring an exponential-size data structure, and with a good worst-time complexity analysis, which makes it competitive with the best existing algorithms for this problem. Our algorithm can be used to compute the edges of the lattice as well at no extra cost.", "paper_title": "A local approach to concept generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248606400008"}
